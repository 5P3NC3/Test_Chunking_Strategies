  "Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.": "A white-box attack assumes the attacker has full knowledge of the machine learning system, including training data and architecture. A black-box attack assumes the attacker has minimal or no knowledge, often only having query access to the model's predictions.",
  "Summarize the plot of the 'Boo Radley' game that Jem, Scout, and Dill play.": "The game is a 'melancholy little drama' based on neighborhood gossip. The plot includes scenes where Boo (played by Jem) is locked up by his father, stabs his father's leg with scissors, and is eventually stuffed up a chimney.
