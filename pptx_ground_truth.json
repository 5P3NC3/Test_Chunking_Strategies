  "What is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack?": "A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is a type of cyberattack where an attacker secretly intercepts and relays communications between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other.",
  "What is the primary function of a network sniffer like Wireshark?": "A network sniffer, or packet analyzer, such as Wireshark, is used to capture and inspect data packets traveling over a computer network in real-time, which can be used to troubleshoot network problems or to sniff unencrypted data like passwords.",
  "What is the difference between a dictionary attack and a brute-force attack for password cracking?": "A dictionary attack uses a pre-arranged list of words (a dictionary) to guess passwords, while a brute-force attack systematically attempts every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found.",
  "What is ARP poisoning?": "ARP poisoning is a technique where an attacker sends spoofed ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages onto a local area network to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or gateway, allowing them to intercept traffic.",
  "How does using HTTPS help prevent password sniffing?": "HTTPS encrypts the data traffic between a user's browser and the web server. This encryption makes it impossible for an attacker sniffing the network to read the sensitive information, such as passwords, being transmitted.",
  "What is a primary cyber threat to scientific and technology organizations?": "A primary cyber threat to scientific and technology organizations is the theft of intellectual property (IP), including proprietary research data, trade secrets, and patentable information.",
  "What is the purpose of access control as a security measure in a research environment?": "Access control ensures that users, including researchers and staff, can only access the specific data and systems that are necessary for their job functions, thereby preventing unauthorized access to sensitive or classified research.",
  "Why is data encryption important for protecting scientific data?": "Data encryption is crucial because it renders sensitive research data unreadable to unauthorized individuals, protecting its confidentiality whether it is being stored on a server (at rest) or transmitted across a network (in transit).",
  "What is a 'Social Engineering' attack in the context of cybersecurity?": "Social engineering is a manipulation technique used by attackers to trick individuals into divulging confidential information, such as login credentials, or performing actions that could compromise security, like opening a malicious attachment.",
  "What challenge does collaboration pose to cybersecurity in the SciTech community?": "Collaboration, while essential for scientific advancement, increases cybersecurity risk by expanding the number of individuals and organizations with access to sensitive data, requiring robust security controls and data sharing agreements to manage the threat surface.",
  "What is a cybersecurity framework?": "A cybersecurity framework is a structured set of guidelines, best practices, and standards designed to help organizations manage and reduce their cybersecurity risk in a methodical way.",
  "What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework?": "The five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.",
  "What is the purpose of the 'Identify' function within the NIST CSF?": "The 'Identify' function is focused on developing an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.",
  "What is the goal of the 'Detect' function in a cybersecurity framework?": "The goal of the 'Detect' function is to enable the timely discovery of cybersecurity events, such as breaches or intrusions, through continuous monitoring and other detection processes.",
  "What is one benefit of adopting a framework like ISO/IEC 27001?": "Adopting a framework like ISO/IEC 27001 provides an internationally recognized, systematic approach to managing information security, which can help an organization achieve regulatory compliance and build trust with customers and partners.",
  "What is a software supply chain attack?": "A software supply chain attack is a cyberattack that targets a trusted third-party vendor or open-source dependency to compromise the final end-user by injecting malicious code into a legitimate product.",
  "What is a common vector for a software supply chain attack?": "A common vector is compromising a software vendor's development or build environment to inject malicious code, which is then signed, packaged, and distributed as part of a legitimate software update.",
  "What is a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)?": "A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a formal, machine-readable inventory of all the components, libraries, and dependencies included in a piece of software, which helps organizations manage vulnerabilities and license compliance.",
  "How can developers help mitigate software supply chain risks?": "Developers can mitigate risks by verifying the integrity and authenticity of third-party software components and libraries, for example by checking digital signatures and checksums, before incorporating them into their applications.",
  "Why was the SolarWinds attack a significant example of a software supply chain attack?": "The SolarWinds attack was significant because attackers compromised the build process for the Orion Platform, embedding a backdoor into legitimate software updates. These malicious updates were then digitally signed and distributed to thousands of high-profile government and corporate customers."
