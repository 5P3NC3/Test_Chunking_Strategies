| What is the purpose of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) as described in the SP 800-37r2 draft?                             | The Risk Management Framework (RMF) as described in the SP 800-37r2 draft serves the purpose of providing a comprehensive and seamless method for organizations to prepare for cybersecurity risk management. It offers a means for agencies to select, implement, assess, and continuously monitor security controls to safeguard federal information systems and organizations. Moreover, it provides an effective way to report and communicate risk-based information and risk-related decisions to officials at various levels of the federal government, thus helping agencies leverage the Cybersecurity Framework and the underlying risk management processes provided by the RMF for more consistent and cost-effective security solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ['chapter three\n\nthe process\n\nEXECUTING THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK TASKS\n\nT\n\nhis chapter describes the process of applying the RMF to systems and organizations. The process includes a set of risk-based tasks that are to be carried out by selected individuals or groups within defined organizational roles. Many risk management roles defined in this publication have counterpart roles defined in the system development life cycle process. Whenever possible, and consistent with missions and business functions, organizations align risk management roles with similar or complementary roles defined for the system development life cycle. RMF tasks are executed concurrently with or as part of the system development life cycle processes in the organization. This helps to ensure that organizations are effectively integrating the process of managing system-related security and privacy risks with their life cycle processes.\n\nEach step in the RMF has a purpose statement, a defined set of outcomes, and a set of tasks that are carried out to achieve those outcomes. Each task contains a set of potential inputs needed to execute the task and a set of potential outputs generated from task execution. In addition, each task describes the phase of the system development life cycle where task execution takes place and the risk management roles and responsibilities associated with the task. Finally, there are references and supplemental guidance to provide organizations with information on how to effectively execute each task.\n\n\n\nFLEXIBILITY IN RMF IMPLEMENTATION\n\nOrganizations have significant flexibility in developing their security and privacy programs—including the selection of baseline security and privacy controls and tailoring the controls to meet organizational security and privacy needs.

The federal implementation of the Cybersecurity Framework will focus on—\n\nthe preconditions and essential activities necessary to prepare for the enterprise-wide execution of the RMF and the conduct of the associated risk management actions at the information system level; and\n\nthe postconditions and essential activities necessary to report the findings and risk-based decisions of authorizing officials for information systems and common controls to agency heads and the senior leaders in the Executive Branch.\n\nEach task in the RMF includes references to applicable sections of the Cybersecurity Framework. For example, Organizational Preparation, Task 2, Risk Management Strategy, provides a direct linkage to the Cybersecurity Framework Core [Identify Function]; Organizational Preparation, Task 10, Organization-Wide Tailored Control Baselines and Profiles, aligns with the construct of Cybersecurity Framework Profiles; and Authorization, Task 6, Authorization Reporting, and Task 5, Security Status Reporting, support OMB risk management and status reporting requirements using the Cybersecurity Framework functions, categories, and subcategories. A mapping of Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories to the NIST Special Publication 800-53 security controls is available at: https://www.nist.gov/file/372651.\n\nIn summary, the federal implementation of the Cybersecurity Framework will provide agencies with a holistic and seamless method to prepare for cybersecurity risk management; the ability to use the RMF to select, implement, assess, and continuously monitor security controls to protect federal information systems and organizations; and an effective method to report and communicate risk-based information and risk-related decisions to officials at all levels of the federal government. Such preparation, execution, and communication can help agencies take maximum advantage of the Cybersecurity Framework and the underlying risk management processes provided by the RMF at the execution level to help achieve more consistent and cost-effective security solutions.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Any weaknesses or deficiencies in controls can be addressed in the RMF steps addressing implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring in the same manner as in new development systems. If no weaknesses or deficiencies are discovered during the gap analysis and there is a current authorization in effect, the organization can move directly to the last step in the RMF, continuous monitoring. If a current authorization is not in place, the organization continues with the assessment, authorization, and monitoring steps in the RMF.\n\n\n\nORGANIZATIONAL PREPARATION\n\nOrganizational preparation prior to applying the Risk Management Framework can achieve more effective, efficient, and cost-effective execution of organizational risk management processes. The primary objectives of organizational preparation are:\n\nTo facilitate better communication between senior leaders and executives at the organization and mission/business process levels and system owners—conveying acceptable limits regarding the implementation of security and privacy controls within established organizational risk tolerance;\n\nTo facilitate organization-wide identification of common controls and the development of organization-wide tailored security and privacy control baselines, to reduce the workload on individual system owners and the cost of system development and protection;\n\nTo reduce the complexity of the IT infrastructure by consolidating, standardizing, and optimizing systems, applications, and services through the application of enterprise architecture concepts and models; and\n\nTo identify, prioritize, and focus resources on high-value assets and high-impact systems that require increased levels of protection—taking steps commensurate with risk such as moving lower impact systems to cloud or shared services, systems, and applications.\n\nThese objectives will significantly reduce the information technology footprint and attack surface of organizations, promote IT modernization objectives, and prioritize security and privacy activities to focus protection strategies on the most critical assets and systems.\n\nORGANIZATIONAL PREPARATION\n\nOrganizational preparation prior to applying the Risk Management Framework can achieve more effective, efficient, and cost-effective execution of organizational risk management processes.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | The objective of the 'Prepare' step is to carry out essential activities at the organization, mission and business process, and system levels to help prepare the organization to manage its security and privacy risks.                                                        |      1         |           0.870669 |                 1   |              nan | sentence_splitter   |

The process includes a set of risk-based tasks that are to be carried out by selected individuals or groups within defined organizational roles. Many risk management roles defined in this publication have counterpart roles defined in the system development life cycle process. Whenever possible, and consistent with missions and business functions, organizations align risk management roles with similar or complementary roles defined for the system development life cycle. RMF tasks are executed concurrently with or as part of the system development life cycle processes in the organization. This helps to ensure that organizations are effectively integrating the process of managing system-related security and privacy risks with their life cycle processes.\n\nEach step in the RMF has a purpose statement, a defined set of outcomes, and a set of tasks that are carried out to achieve those outcomes. Each task contains a set of potential inputs needed to execute the task and a set of potential outputs generated from task execution. In addition, each task describes the phase of the system development life cycle where task execution takes place and the risk management roles and responsibilities associated with the task. Finally, there are references and supplemental guidance to provide organizations with information on how to effectively execute each task.\n\n\n\nFLEXIBILITY IN RMF IMPLEMENTATION\n\nOrganizations have significant flexibility in developing their security and privacy programs—including the selection of baseline security and privacy controls and tailoring the controls to meet organizational security and privacy needs. The implementation of common controls and thoughtful control tailoring help to ensure that security and privacy solutions are “rightsized” for the organization’s missions, business functions, and operating environments.\n\n\n\nFLEXIBILITY IN RMF IMPLEMENTATION\n\nOrganizations have significant flexibility in developing their security and privacy programs—including the selection of baseline security and privacy controls and tailoring the controls to meet organizational security and privacy needs.

Such preparation, execution, and communication can help agencies take maximum advantage of the Cybersecurity Framework and the underlying risk management processes provided by the RMF at the execution level to help achieve more consistent and cost-effective security solutions.\n\nMANAGING INFORMATION SECURITY RISK\n\nUsing the Cybersecurity Framework\n\nExecutive Order (E.O.) 13800 requires federal agencies to modernize their IT infrastructure and systems, and recognizes the increasing interconnectedness of federal information systems and networks. The E.O. also requires agency heads to manage risk at the agency level and across the Executive Branch using the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (also known as the Cybersecurity Framework) developed by NIST. And finally, the E.O. reinforces the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 by holding agency heads accountable for managing the cybersecurity risk to their enterprises.\n\nThe Cybersecurity Framework is adaptive to provide a flexible and risk-based implementation that can be used with a broad array of cybersecurity risk management processes. Therefore, consistent with OMB Memorandum M-17-25, the federal implementation of the Cybersecurity Framework will employ the risk management processes defined in NIST Special Publications 800-39 and 800-37. This will allow agencies to meet their concurrent obligations to comply with the requirements of FISMA and E.O. 13800.\n\nTo ensure an effective and efficient transition to Cybersecurity Framework implementation, the Risk Management Framework (RMF) has been modified in this update in several key areas.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

In certain situations, tailoring actions may be restricted or limited by the developer of the tailored baseline or by the issuing authority for the tailored baseline. Tailored baselines (overlays) have been developed for cloud and shared systems, services, and applications; national security systems; weapons and space-based systems; high-value assets; mobile device management; federal public key infrastructure; and privacy applications.\n\nOrganizations may also benefit from the creation of a Cybersecurity Framework profile. A profile is a prioritization of the Framework Core Categories and/or Subcategory outcomes based on business/mission functions, security requirements, and risk determinations. Many of the tasks in organizational preparation provide an enterprise-level view of these considerations and can serve as inputs to a profile. The resulting prioritized list of cybersecurity outcomes developed at the Enterprise and Mission/Business Process levels of an organization can be helpful in driving consistent, risk-based decisions at the system level during the execution of the RMF steps. The profile can be used to guide and inform the development of the tailored security and privacy control baselines described above.\n\nReferences:  NIST Special Publications 800-53, 800-160 (Business or Mission Analysis, Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition Process); Cybersecurity Framework (Core, Profiles).\n\nCOMMON CONTROL IDENTIFICATION\n\nTask 11\tIdentify and publish organization-wide common controls that are available for inheritance by organizational systems. \n\nPotential Inputs:  Documented stakeholder protection needs and stakeholder security and privacy requirements; existing common control providers and associated system security and privacy plans; organizational information security and privacy program plans.\n\nPotential Outputs:  List of common control providers and common controls available for inheritance; security and privacy plans (or equivalent documents) providing a functional description of the common control implementation (including inputs, expected behavior, and expected outputs).\n\nPrimary Responsibility:  Chief Information Officer; Senior Information Agency Security Officer; Senior Agency Official for Privacy; Senior Accountable Official for Risk Management or Risk Executive (Function).\n\nSystem Development Life Cycle Phase:  New – Initiation (concept/requirements definition).\n\nExisting – Operations/Maintenance.\n\nSupplemental Guidance:  Common controls are security and privacy controls that can be inherited by one or more organizational systems.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

| According to the NIST CSF Audit survey, what should an organization have in place regarding its supply chain risk management? | An organization should have in place tailored Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) plans that are aligned with their organizational context and risk environment. These SCRM plans should involve identifying and assessing applicable risks, determining appropriate mitigating actions, developing appropriate SCRIM plans to document selected mitigating actions, and monitoring performance against these plans. The organization should also manage supply chain risks as a complex, multifaceted undertaking requiring a coordinated effort across the organization. This includes engaging multiple disciplines in identifying priorities and developing solutions, ensuring that robust SCRM activities are performed throughout the system development life cycle, and incorporating SCRM into overall risk management decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ['Security and privacy requirements for external providers including the security and privacy controls for systems processing, storing, or transmitting federal information are expressed in contracts or other formal agreements. Organizations require external providers to implement all steps in the RMF except for the authorization step, which remains an inherent federal responsibility that is directly linked to the management of risk related to the use of external system services. \n\nOMB policy also requires departments and agencies to develop and implement supply chain risk management plans. Managing supply chain risks is a complex, multifaceted undertaking requiring a coordinated effort across an organization—building trust relationships and communicating with internal and external stakeholders. This includes engaging multiple disciplines in identifying priorities and developing solutions; ensuring that robust supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities are performed throughout the system development life cycle; and incorporating SCRM into overall risk management decisions. SCRM activities should involve\xa0identifying and assessing applicable risks, determining appropriate mitigating actions, developing appropriate SCRM plans to document selected mitigating actions, and monitoring performance against SCRM plans. Because supply chains differ across and within organizations, SCRM plans should be tailored to individual organizational, program, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans provide the basis for determining whether a system is “fit for purpose” and as such, the security and privacy controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans will help organizations to focus appropriate resources on the most critical functions and components based on organizational mission/business requirements and their risk environment.\xa0\n\nThe assurance or confidence that the risk from using products, systems, or services from external providers is at an acceptable level depends on the level of assurance that the organization can gain from the providers. The level of assurance is based on the degree of control the organization can exert on the external provider regarding the security and privacy controls necessary for the protection of the product, system, or service and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls. The degree of control can be established by the terms and conditions of the contract or service-level agreement. Some organizations have extensive control of the required security and privacy controls through contract vehicles or agreements that specify the security and privacy requirements for the external provider. Other organizations have rather limited control because of purchasing commodity services or commercial off-the-shelf products.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The organization should have a process to identify, establish, and assess cybersecurity requirements for suppliers and third-party partners of information systems, components, and services.                                                                                   |      1         |           0.759496 |                 1   |              nan | sentence_splitter   |

This decision is made during the Authorization step of the RMF process. The AO can make this determination based on an authorization package or a report from an automated security/privacy management and reporting tool. Additionally, they are responsible for coordinating their activities with various parties throughout the authorization process, such as common control providers, system owners, and senior agency information security officers, among others. If necessary, agreements may be established among multiple AOs, and the role of AO has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ['Authorizing officials typically have budgetary oversight for the system or are responsible for the mission and/or business operations supported by the system. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in management positions with a level of authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such security and privacy risks. Authorizing officials approve security and privacy plans, memorandums of agreement or understanding, plans of action and milestones, and determine whether significant changes in the systems or environments of operation require reauthorization.\n\nAuthorizing officials coordinate their activities with common control providers, system owners, chief information officers, senior agency information security officers, senior agency official for privacy, system security and privacy officers, control assessors, senior accountable officials for risk management/risk executive (function), and other interested parties during the authorization process. With the increasing complexity of mission/business processes, partnership arrangements, and the use of shared services, it is possible that a system may involve multiple authorizing officials. If so, agreements are established among the authorizing officials and documented in the security plan. Authorizing officials are responsible for ensuring that activities and functions associated with authorization that are delegated to authorizing official designated representatives are carried out. The role of authorizing official has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.\n\nauthorizing official designated representative\n\nThe authorizing official designated representative is an organizational official that acts on behalf of an authorizing official to coordinate and conduct the required day-to-day activities associated with the authorization process. Authorizing official designated representatives can be empowered by authorizing officials to make certain decisions regarding the planning and resourcing of the authorization process; approval of the security and privacy plans; approval and monitoring the implementation of plans of action and milestones; and the assessment and determination of risk. The designated representative may be called upon to prepare the authorization package; obtain the authorizing official’s signature on the authorization decision document; and transmit the authorization package to the appropriate organizational officials. The only activity that cannot be delegated to the authorizing official designated representative is the authorization decision and signing of the associated authorization decision document (i.e., the acceptance of risk).'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The Authorizing Official is a senior federal official or executive with the authority to formally assume responsibility for operating a system at an acceptable level of risk to organizational operations, assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.           |      1         |           0.561327 |                 1   |              nan | sentence_splitter   |

The authorizing official uses this information to determine if the mission/business risk of operating a system or providing common controls is acceptable—and if it is, explicitly accepts the risk. Security- and privacy-related information is presented to the authorizing official either in an authorization package or by retrieving a report from an automated security/privacy management and reporting tool. System and common control authorization occurs as part of the RMF Authorization step. A system authorization or common control authorization can be the initial authorization, ongoing authorization, or a reauthorization as defined below:\n\nInitial authorization is defined as the initial (start-up) risk determination and risk acceptance decision based on a zero-base review of the system or the common controls inherited by the system. The zero-base review includes an assessment of all security and privacy controls contained in the security and privacy plans and implemented within the system or the environment in which the system operates. The initial authorization for the system and the common controls inherited by the system may have different authorizing officials.\n\nOngoing authorization is defined as the subsequent (i.e., follow-on) risk determinations and risk acceptance decisions taken at agreed-upon and documented frequencies in accordance with the organization’s mission/business requirements and organizational risk tolerance. Ongoing authorization is a time-driven or event-driven authorization process whereby the authorizing official is provided with the necessary and sufficient information regarding the near real-time security state of the system (including the effectiveness of the security and privacy controls employed within and inherited by the system) to determine whether the mission/business risk of continued system operation or the provision of common controls is acceptable. Ongoing authorization is fundamentally related to the ongoing understanding and ongoing acceptance of security and privacy risk.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

The tasks are applied at appropriate phases in the system development life cycle. While the tasks appear in sequential order, there can be many points in the risk management process that require divergence from the sequential order including the need for iterative cycles between initial task execution and revisiting tasks. For example, security and privacy control assessment results can trigger a set of remediation actions by system owners and common control providers, which can in turn require the reassessment of selected controls. Monitoring security and privacy controls in a system can generate a cycle of tracking changes to the system and its environment of operation; conducting security and privacy impact analyses; taking selected remediation actions, reassessing controls, and reporting the security and privacy status of the system.\n\nThere may also be other opportunities to diverge from the sequential nature of the tasks when it is more effective, efficient, or cost-effective to do so. For example, while the security and privacy control assessment tasks are listed after the security and privacy control implementation tasks, organizations may choose to begin the assessment of controls as soon as they are implemented but prior to the complete implementation of all controls described in the security and privacy plans. This may result in some organizations assessing the physical and environmental protection controls within a facility prior to assessing the controls employed in the hardware, firmware, or software components of the system (which may be implemented later). Regardless of the task ordering, the final action before a system is placed into operation is the explicit acceptance of risk by the authorizing official.\n\nThe RMF steps and the associated tasks can be applied to new development and existing systems. For new and existing systems, organizations ensure that the designated tasks have been completed to adequately prepare for the RMF execution. For existing systems, organizations confirm that the security categorization and (for systems processing personally identifiable information) a privacy risk assessment have been completed and are appropriate; and that the needed controls have been selected and implemented. Applying these steps to existing systems can serve as a gap analysis to determine if adequate security and the required protection, including privacy protections, for the system have been achieved.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The primary output of the 'Select' step is the documentation of the security and privacy controls that have been selected for the system and the organization.                                                                                                                  |    nan         |           1        |                 1   |              nan | sentence_splitter   |

The process includes a set of risk-based tasks that are to be carried out by selected individuals or groups within defined organizational roles. Many risk management roles defined in this publication have counterpart roles defined in the system development life cycle process. Whenever possible, and consistent with missions and business functions, organizations align risk management roles with similar or complementary roles defined for the system development life cycle. RMF tasks are executed concurrently with or as part of the system development life cycle processes in the organization. This helps to ensure that organizations are effectively integrating the process of managing system-related security and privacy risks with their life cycle processes.\n\nEach step in the RMF has a purpose statement, a defined set of outcomes, and a set of tasks that are carried out to achieve those outcomes. Each task contains a set of potential inputs needed to execute the task and a set of potential outputs generated from task execution. In addition, each task describes the phase of the system development life cycle where task execution takes place and the risk management roles and responsibilities associated with the task. Finally, there are references and supplemental guidance to provide organizations with information on how to effectively execute each task.\n\n\n\nFLEXIBILITY IN RMF IMPLEMENTATION\n\nOrganizations have significant flexibility in developing their security and privacy programs—including the selection of baseline security and privacy controls and tailoring the controls to meet organizational security and privacy needs. The implementation of common controls and thoughtful control tailoring help to ensure that security and privacy solutions are “rightsized” for the organization’s missions, business functions, and operating environments.\n\n\n\nFLEXIBILITY IN RMF IMPLEMENTATION\n\nOrganizations have significant flexibility in developing their security and privacy programs—including the selection of baseline security and privacy controls and tailoring the controls to meet organizational security and privacy needs.

Organizations executing the RMF for the first time, will typically carry out the steps in sequential order, although they may choose to revisit certain steps during initial execution. Once the system is in the operations and maintenance phase of the system development life cycle as part of the continuous monitoring step, events may dictate nonsequential execution.  \n\nAlthough the risk management approach in Figure 2 is conveyed as hierarchical, project and organization dynamics are typically more complex. The risk management approach selected by an organization may vary on a continuum from top-down command to decentralized consensus among peers. However, in all cases, organizations must have a consistent and effective approach that is applied to risk management processes from the organization level to the system level. It is imperative that organizational officials identify and secure the needed resources to complete the risk management tasks described in this publication and ensure that those resources are made available to the appropriate personnel. Resource allocation includes funding to conduct risk management tasks and assigning qualified personnel needed to accomplish the tasks.\n\n2.3   security and privacy relationship\n\nAs noted in OMB Circular A-130: \n\n“Federal information is a strategic asset subject to risks that must be managed to minimize harm; Protecting an individual’s privacy is of utmost importance. The Federal Government shall consider and protect an individual’s privacy throughout the information life cycle; While security and privacy are independent and separate disciplines, they are closely related, and it is essential for agencies to take a coordinated approach to identifying and managing security and privacy risks and complying with applicable requirements.” \n\nSecurity and privacy have complementary and mutually-reinforcing objectives with respect to managing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personally identifiable information (PII), but individual privacy cannot be achieved solely by securing PII. Figure 4 demonstrates the overlap in objectives, and also shows that privacy risks can arise as a by-product of authorized or intentional processing of PII.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The purpose of the 'Monitor' step is to maintain ongoing situational awareness of the security and privacy posture of the system and the organization to support risk management decisions.                                                                                     |      0.7       |           0.989694 |                 1   |              nan | sentence_splitter   |

Building on the terms system and system element, the term system-of-interest defines the set of system elements, system element interconnections, and the environment that provides the focus for the system boundary determination and the RMF implementation. The system-of-interest may be supported by one or more enabling systems that provide support to the system life cycle activities associated with the system-of-interest. Enabling systems are not necessarily delivered with the system-of-interest and do not necessarily exist in the operational environment of the system of interest. Finally, there are other systems the system-of-interest interacts with in the operational environment. These systems may provide services to the system-of-interest or may be the beneficiaries of services provided by the system-of-interest (i.e., potential two-way dependencies). Table 1 lists the system-related constructs that are foundational to RMF implementation.\n\nTABLE 1:  FOUNDATIONAL SYSTEM-RELATED CONSTRUCTS\n\nsystem\n\nCombination of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purposes.\n\nExamples include: general and special-purpose information systems; industrial/process control systems; weapons systems; medical devices and treatment systems; social networking systems; and financial, banking, and merchandising transaction systems.\n\nsystem element\n\nMember of a set of elements that constitute a system.\n\nExamples include: hardware; software; firmware; data; facilities; materials; humans; processes; and procedures.\n\nsystem-of-interest\n\nSystem that is the focus of the systems engineering effort.\n\nDefines the information system that is the focus of the RMF implementation and the authorization boundary for the system.\n\nenabling system\n\nSystem that supports a system-of-interest during any of its life cycle stages but does not necessarily contribute directly to its function during operation.\n\nExamples include: modeling, simulation, and design tools; test scenario generators and test harnesses; training system and tools; software and firmware compilers; hardware design tools, and fabrication and manufacturing systems.\n\nother system\n\nSystem that interacts with the system-of-interest in its operational environment.\n\nExamples include: a global positioning system space vehicle being an “other system” interacting with a GPS receiver as the “system-of-interest.”\n\nSource:  ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288: 2015'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | A system is defined as any organized assembly of resources and procedures united and regulated by interaction or interdependence to accomplish a set of specific functions, including applications, networks, and cloud-based systems.                                          |      1         |           0.568344 |                 1   |              nan | sentence_splitter   |

A common area of concern for organizations is the often-blurred lines with respect to system boundaries and the frequent dependencies between systems. This area of concern is heightened in situations where low-impact systems are connected to higher-impact systems, either knowingly or unknowingly. In the absence of clearly defined system boundaries, the security categorization cannot be determined with any degree of accuracy. Therefore, the responsibility and accountability for the security of the system cannot be assigned. Each system consists of a set of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purposes and supporting the organization’s missions and business processes. Each system element is implemented to fulfill specified requirements including security and privacy requirements. System elements include human elements, technology/machine elements, and physical/environmental elements. System elements are implemented via hardware, software, or firmware; physical structures or devices; or people, processes, and procedures.\n\nFor a large or complex system, a system element may be regarded as a system and will itself be composed of system elements. The hierarchical and context-dependent nature of the terms system and system element allows the term system to be used when referring to a discrete component or a complex, geographically distributed system-of-systems. Because the term system can be applied across a continuum from composed elements to a discrete element, the context in which the term system is being used must be communicated and understood. The term system-of-interest is used to define the set of system elements, system element interconnections, and the environment that is the focus of the RMF implementation. For systems processing personally identifiable information, it is essential that privacy and security programs collaborate to develop a common and shared understanding of the system boundary.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

In certain situations, tailoring actions may be restricted or limited by the developer of the tailored baseline or by the issuing authority for the tailored baseline. Tailored baselines (overlays) have been developed for cloud and shared systems, services, and applications; national security systems; weapons and space-based systems; high-value assets; mobile device management; federal public key infrastructure; and privacy applications.\n\nOrganizations may also benefit from the creation of a Cybersecurity Framework profile. A profile is a prioritization of the Framework Core Categories and/or Subcategory outcomes based on business/mission functions, security requirements, and risk determinations. Many of the tasks in organizational preparation provide an enterprise-level view of these considerations and can serve as inputs to a profile. The resulting prioritized list of cybersecurity outcomes developed at the Enterprise and Mission/Business Process levels of an organization can be helpful in driving consistent, risk-based decisions at the system level during the execution of the RMF steps. The profile can be used to guide and inform the development of the tailored security and privacy control baselines described above.\n\nReferences:  NIST Special Publications 800-53, 800-160 (Business or Mission Analysis, Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition Process); Cybersecurity Framework (Core, Profiles).\n\nCOMMON CONTROL IDENTIFICATION\n\nTask 11\tIdentify and publish organization-wide common controls that are available for inheritance by organizational systems. \n\nPotential Inputs:  Documented stakeholder protection needs and stakeholder security and privacy requirements; existing common control providers and associated system security and privacy plans; organizational information security and privacy program plans.\n\nPotential Outputs:  List of common control providers and common controls available for inheritance; security and privacy plans (or equivalent documents) providing a functional description of the common control implementation (including inputs, expected behavior, and expected outputs).\n\nPrimary Responsibility:  Chief Information Officer; Senior Information Agency Security Officer; Senior Agency Official for Privacy; Senior Accountable Official for Risk Management or Risk Executive (Function).\n\nSystem Development Life Cycle Phase:  New – Initiation (concept/requirements definition).\n\nExisting – Operations/Maintenance.\n\nSupplemental Guidance:  Common controls are security and privacy controls that can be inherited by one or more organizational systems.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

| What is a fundamental question in the 'Identify' function concerning Asset Management?                                        | A fundamental question in the 'Identify' function concerning Asset Management is whether or not the organization develops and documents policy for an inventory of information system components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ['Prioritization of assets is based on the stakeholder assessment of acceptance of the adverse consequence of loss. This is reflected in terms of asset value, criticality, cost of replacement, impact on image or reputation, or trust by users, by mission or business partners, or by collaborating organizations. The asset priority translates to precedence in allocating resources, determining strength of mechanisms, and defining levels of assurance. Asset valuation is a precondition for defining stakeholder protection needs and security requirements.\n\nAnother aspect of risk assessment is the determination of asset susceptibility to adversity and uncertainty. Adversity includes all forms of potential disruptions, threats, and hazards across all human, physical, technology/machine, and environmental forms throughout the system’s life cycle. Adversity consists of those events and preexisting or emergent conditions that combine to produce the loss of assets and the associated adverse consequences to stakeholders. Adversity comes in malicious and non-malicious forms and can emanate from a variety of sources including, for example, simple or sophisticated attacks (i.e., cyber, electronic, supply chain, physical, social); human error (i.e., commission or omission); abuse and misuse; accidents and incidents; component fault or failure; and natural or man-made disasters. The identification and assessment of adversity characterizes the events and conditions that are anticipated throughout the life cycle of the system and correlates those events and conditions to the asset loss concerns of stakeholders. The correlation of asset susceptibility to adversity with loss consequence considers what is known, what is possible, what is likely, and what is uncertain.\n\nThe uncertainty about how an asset loss consequence might occur is not sufficient grounds to dismiss such a consequence. Uncertainty, as it relates to adversity, is addressed by considerations of those situations where there are known consequences that can be forecast and deemed unacceptable and for which there is an absence of direct, specific, or credible knowledge of an adverse event-to-consequence relationship, or for which there is insufficient basis to forecast such a relationship. There are also limits on what specific knowledge is obtainable and thus, adverse consequences can occur for reasons that are unknown until the actual event occurs. Nonetheless, adverse impact can be minimized and the uncertainty-to-consequence relationship addressed as part of the determination of susceptibility to threats.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | A fundamental question is whether the data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to the organization’s risk strategy.                     |    nan         |           0.314563 |                 1   |              nan | sentence_splitter   |

It includes activities like organizational asset valuation, control selection and implementation, system authorization, and continuous monitoring at both enterprise and system levels. The RMF also integrates security and privacy controls into the system development life cycle, promoting near real-time risk management and ongoing system authorization through continuous monitoring processes. Additionally, it establishes responsibility and accountability for the security and privacy controls within organizational systems and provides senior leaders with necessary information to make cost-effective risk management decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ['Therefore, consistent with OMB Memorandum M-17-25, the federal implementation of the Cybersecurity Framework will employ the risk management processes defined in NIST Special Publications 800-39 and 800-37. This will allow agencies to meet their concurrent obligations to comply with the requirements of FISMA and E.O. 13800.\n\nTo ensure an effective and efficient transition to Cybersecurity Framework implementation, the Risk Management Framework (RMF) has been modified in this update in several key areas. The federal implementation of the Cybersecurity Framework will focus on—\n\nthe preconditions and essential activities necessary to prepare for the enterprise-wide execution of the RMF and the conduct of the associated risk management actions at the information system level; and\n\nthe postconditions and essential activities necessary to report the findings and risk-based decisions of authorizing officials for information systems and common controls to agency heads and the senior leaders in the Executive Branch.\n\nEach task in the RMF includes references to applicable sections of the Cybersecurity Framework. For example, Organizational Preparation, Task 2, Risk Management Strategy, provides a direct linkage to the Cybersecurity Framework Core [Identify Function]; Organizational Preparation, Task 10, Organization-Wide Tailored Control Baselines and Profiles, aligns with the construct of Cybersecurity Framework Profiles; and Authorization, Task 6, Authorization Reporting, and Task 5, Security Status Reporting, support OMB risk management and status reporting requirements using the Cybersecurity Framework functions, categories, and subcategories. A mapping of Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories to the NIST Special Publication 800-53 security controls is available at: https://www.nist.gov/file/372651.\n\nIn summary, the federal implementation of the Cybersecurity Framework will provide agencies with a holistic and seamless method to prepare for cybersecurity risk management; the ability to use the RMF to select, implement, assess, and continuously monitor security controls to protect federal information systems and organizations; and an effective method to report and communicate risk-based information and risk-related decisions to officials at all levels of the federal government. Such preparation, execution, and communication can help agencies take maximum advantage of the Cybersecurity Framework and the underlying risk management processes provided by the RMF at the execution level to help achieve more consistent and cost-effective security solutions.\n\nMANAGING INFORMATION SECURITY RISK\n\nUsing the'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The purpose of the Risk Management Framework is to provide a disciplined, structured, and repeatable process for managing cybersecurity and privacy risk that integrates security, privacy, and supply chain risk management activities into the system development life cycle. |      0.941176  |           1        |                 1   |              nan | token_text_splitter |

The RMF includes a disciplined, structured, and flexible process for organizational asset valuation; security and privacy control selection, implementation, and assessment; system and control authorizations; and continuous monitoring. It also includes enterprise-level activities to help better prepare organizations to execute the RMF at the system level. The RMF promotes the concept of near real-time risk management and ongoing system authorization through the implementation of continuous monitoring processes; provides senior leaders and executives with the necessary information to make cost-effective, risk management decisions about the systems supporting their missions and business functions; and integrates security and privacy controls into the system development life cycle. Applying the RMF tasks enterprise-wide helps to link essential risk management processes at the system level to risk management processes at the organization level. In addition, it establishes responsibility and accountability for the security and privacy controls deployed within organizational systems and inherited by those systems. The RMF incorporates concepts from the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity that complement the currently established risk management processes mandated by the Office of Management and Budget and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act.\n\nKeywords\n\nassess; authorization to operate; common control authorization; authorization to use; authorizing official; categorize; common control; common control provider; continuous monitoring; hybrid control; implement; information owner/steward; monitor; ongoing authorization; plan of action and milestones; privacy assessment report; privacy control; privacy plan; risk; risk assessment; risk executive function; risk management; risk management framework; threat intelligence; threat modelling; security assessment report; security control; security plan; senior agency information security officer; senior agency official for privacy; system development life cycle; system owner; system privacy officer; system security officer.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis publication was developed by the Joint Task Force Interagency Working Group.

Organizations executing the RMF for the first time, will typically carry out the steps in sequential order, although they may choose to revisit certain steps during initial execution. Once the system is in the operations and maintenance phase of the system development life cycle as part of the continuous monitoring step, events may dictate nonsequential execution.  \n\nAlthough the risk management approach in Figure 2 is conveyed as hierarchical, project and organization dynamics are typically more complex. The risk management approach selected by an organization may vary on a continuum from top-down command to decentralized consensus among peers. However, in all cases, organizations must have a consistent and effective approach that is applied to risk management processes from the organization level to the system level. It is imperative that organizational officials identify and secure the needed resources to complete the risk management tasks described in this publication and ensure that those resources are made available to the appropriate personnel. Resource allocation includes funding to conduct risk management tasks and assigning qualified personnel needed to accomplish the tasks.\n\n2.3   security and privacy relationship\n\nAs noted in OMB Circular A-130: \n\n“Federal information is a strategic asset subject to risks that must be managed to minimize harm; Protecting an individual’s privacy is of utmost importance. The Federal Government shall consider and protect an individual’s privacy throughout the information life cycle; While security and privacy are independent and separate disciplines, they are closely related, and it is essential for agencies to take a coordinated approach to identifying and managing security and privacy risks and complying with applicable requirements.” \n\nSecurity and privacy'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The seven steps of the Risk Management Framework are Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, and Monitor.                                                                                                                                                    |      1         |           0.734784 |                 1   |              nan | token_text_splitter |

Organizations executing the RMF for the first time, will typically carry out the steps in sequential order, although they may choose to revisit certain steps during initial execution. Once the system is in the operations and maintenance phase of the system development life cycle as part of the continuous monitoring step, events may dictate nonsequential execution.  \n\nAlthough the risk management approach in Figure 2 is conveyed as hierarchical, project and organization dynamics are typically more complex. The risk management approach selected by an organization may vary on a continuum from top-down command to decentralized consensus among peers. However, in all cases, organizations must have a consistent and effective approach that is applied to risk management processes from the organization level to the system level. It is imperative that organizational officials identify and secure the needed resources to complete the risk management tasks described in this publication and ensure that those resources are made available to the appropriate personnel. Resource allocation includes funding to conduct risk management tasks and assigning qualified personnel needed to accomplish the tasks.\n\n2.3   security and privacy relationship\n\nAs noted in OMB Circular A-130: \n\n“Federal information is a strategic asset subject to risks that must be managed to minimize harm; Protecting an individual’s privacy is of utmost importance. The Federal Government shall consider and protect an individual’s privacy throughout the information life cycle; While security and privacy are independent and separate disciplines, they are closely related, and it is essential for agencies to take a coordinated approach to identifying and managing security and privacy risks and complying with applicable requirements.” \n\nSecurity and privacy'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The objective of the 'Prepare' step is to carry out essential activities at the organization, mission and business process, and system levels to help prepare the organization to manage its security and privacy risks.                                                        |      1         |           0.870294 |                 1   |              nan | token_text_splitter |

Such preparation, execution, and communication can help agencies take maximum advantage of the Cybersecurity Framework and the underlying risk management processes provided by the RMF at the execution level to help achieve more consistent and cost-effective security solutions.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\tchapter one   introduction\t1\n\n1.1   background\t1\n\n1.2   purpose and applicability\t2\n\n1.3   target audience\t3\n\n1.4   organization of this special publication\t4\n\n\tchapter two   the fundamentals\t5\n\n2.1   system and system elements\t5\n\n2.2   organization-wide risk management\t7\n\n2.3   security and privacy relationship\t11\n\n2.4   control allocation\t12\n\n\tchapter three   the process\t16\n\n3.1   preparation\t19\n\n3.2   categorization\t30\n\n3.3   selection\t35\n\n3.4   implementation\t40\n\n3.5   assessment\t43\n\n3.6   authorization\t48\n\n3.7   monitoring\t55\n\n\tappendix a   roles and responsibilities\t62\n\n\tappendix b   summary of rmf tasks\t72\n\n\tappendix c   system and control authorizations\t83\n\n\tappendix d   other']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

| According to the NIST CSF Audit survey, what should an organization have in place regarding its supply chain risk management? | Based on the provided context, an organization should have a comprehensive Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) plan that includes identifying and assessing applicable risks, determining appropriate mitigating actions, developing SCRM plans to document selected mitigating actions, and monitoring performance against those plans. The plans should be tailored to individual organizational, program, and operational contexts, providing the basis for determining whether a system is "fit for purpose" and as such, the security and privacy controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans help organizations focus resources on the most critical functions and components based on organizational mission/business requirements and their risk environment. Additionally, the level of assurance from external providers depends on the level of control the organization can gain from them regarding security and privacy controls necessary for protecting products, systems, or services. This can be established through contracts or service-level agreements. Ultimately, the responsibility for responding to risks remains with the organization and the authorizing official. No specific mention of a NIST CSF Audit survey is found in the provided context. | ['Managing supply chain risks is a complex, multifaceted undertaking requiring a coordinated effort across an organization—building trust relationships and communicating with internal and external stakeholders. This includes engaging multiple disciplines in identifying priorities and developing solutions; ensuring that robust supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities are performed throughout the system development life cycle; and incorporating SCRM into overall risk management decisions. SCRM activities should involve\xa0identifying and assessing applicable risks, determining appropriate mitigating actions, developing appropriate SCRM plans to document selected mitigating actions, and monitoring performance against SCRM plans. Because supply chains differ across and within organizations, SCRM plans should be tailored to individual organizational, program, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans provide the basis for determining whether a system is “fit for purpose” and as such, the security and privacy controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans will help organizations to focus appropriate resources on the most critical functions and components based on organizational mission/business requirements and their risk environment.\xa0\n\nThe assurance or confidence that the risk from using products, systems, or services from external providers is at an acceptable level depends on the level of assurance that the organization can gain from the providers. The level of assurance is based on the degree of control the organization can exert on the external provider regarding the security and privacy controls necessary for the protection of the product, system, or service and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls. The degree of control can be established by the terms and conditions of the contract or service-level agreement. Some organizations have extensive control of the required security and privacy controls through contract vehicles or agreements that specify the security and privacy requirements for the external provider. Other organizations have rather limited control because of purchasing commodity services or commercial off-the-shelf products. The level of assurance can also be based on many other factors that convince the organization that the requisite security and privacy controls have been implemented and that a credible determination of control effectiveness exists.

The AO makes a risk determination and acceptance decision, which may be an initial authorization, ongoing authorization, or reauthorization based on the current state of the system or common controls. The AO has inherent U.S. Government authority and is responsible for ensuring that activities associated with authorization are carried out correctly. If multiple authorizing officials are involved, agreements are established among them, and documented in the security plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ['information security officers, senior agency official for privacy, system security and privacy officers, control assessors, senior accountable officials for risk management/risk executive (function), and other interested parties during the authorization process.

Authorizing official designated representatives can be empowered by authorizing officials to make certain decisions regarding the planning and resourcing of the authorization process; approval of the security and privacy plans; approval and monitoring the implementation of plans of action and milestones; and the assessment and determination of risk. The designated representative may be called upon to prepare the authorization package; obtain the authorizing official’s signature on the authorization decision document; and transmit the authorization package to the appropriate organizational officials. The only activity that cannot be delegated to the authorizing official designated representative is the authorization decision and signing of the associated authorization decision document (i.e., the acceptance of risk).\n\nchief information officer\n\nThe chief information officer is an organizational official responsible for designating a senior agency information security officer;\xa0developing and maintaining security policies, procedures, and control techniques to address applicable requirements;\xa0overseeing personnel with significant responsibilities for security and ensuring that the personnel are adequately trained; assisting senior organizational officials concerning their security responsibilities; and reporting to the head of the agency on the effectiveness of the organization’s security program, including progress of remedial actions.

The authorizing official uses this information to determine if the mission/business risk of operating a system or providing common controls is acceptable—and if it is, explicitly accepts the risk. Security- and privacy-related information is presented to the authorizing official either in an authorization package or by retrieving a report from an automated security/privacy management and reporting tool. System and common control authorization occurs as part of the RMF Authorization step. A system authorization or common control authorization can be the initial authorization, ongoing authorization, or a reauthorization as defined below:\n\nInitial authorization is defined as the initial (start-up) risk determination and risk acceptance decision based on a zero-base review of the system or the common controls inherited by the system. The zero-base review includes an assessment of all security and privacy controls contained in the security and privacy plans and implemented within the system or the environment in which the system operates. The initial authorization for the system and the common controls inherited by the system may have different authorizing officials.\n\nOngoing authorization is defined as the subsequent (i.e., follow-on) risk determinations and risk acceptance decisions taken at agreed-upon and documented frequencies in accordance with the organization’s mission/business requirements and organizational risk tolerance. Ongoing authorization is a time-driven or event-driven authorization process whereby the authorizing official is provided with the necessary and sufficient information regarding the near real-time security state of the system (including the effectiveness of the security and privacy controls employed within and inherited by the system) to determine whether the mission/business risk of continued system operation or the provision of common controls is acceptable. Ongoing authorization is fundamentally related to the ongoing understanding and ongoing acceptance of security and privacy risk. It is also closely related to the dynamic, organization-wide risk management process that provides a refined and articulated situational awareness of the security, privacy, and risk posture of the organization based on the ongoing assessment, response to, and monitoring of security and privacy risk and thus is dependent on a robust continuous monitoring program.\n\nReauthorization is']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Organizations executing the RMF for the first time, will typically carry out the steps in sequential order, although they may choose to revisit certain steps during initial execution. Once the system is in the operations and maintenance phase of the system development life cycle as part of the continuous monitoring step, events may dictate nonsequential execution.  \n\nAlthough the risk management approach in Figure 2 is conveyed as hierarchical, project and organization dynamics are typically more complex. The risk management approach selected by an organization may vary on a continuum from top-down command to decentralized consensus among peers. However, in all cases, organizations must have a consistent and effective approach that is applied to risk management processes from the organization level to the system level. It is imperative that organizational officials identify and secure the needed resources to complete the risk management tasks described in this publication and ensure that those resources are made available to the appropriate personnel.

The frequency of monitoring is determined based on factors such as the system's importance to organizational operations and assets, individual safety, other organizations, and the nation.

The RMF includes a disciplined, structured, and flexible process for organizational asset valuation; security and privacy control selection, implementation, and assessment; system and control authorizations; and continuous monitoring. It also includes enterprise-level activities to help better prepare organizations to execute the RMF at the system level. The RMF promotes the concept of near real-time risk management and ongoing system authorization through the implementation of continuous monitoring processes; provides senior leaders and executives with the necessary information to make cost-effective, risk management decisions about the systems supporting their missions and business functions; and integrates security and privacy controls into the system development life cycle. Applying the RMF tasks enterprise-wide helps to link essential risk management processes at the system level to risk management processes at the organization level. In addition, it establishes responsibility and accountability for the security and privacy controls deployed within organizational systems and inherited by those systems. The RMF incorporates concepts from the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity that complement the currently established risk management processes mandated by the Office of Management and Budget and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act.\n\nKeywords\n\nassess; authorization to operate; common control authorization; authorization to use; authorizing official; categorize; common control; common control provider; continuous monitoring; hybrid control; implement; information owner/steward; monitor; ongoing authorization; plan of action and milestones; privacy assessment report; privacy control; privacy plan; risk; risk assessment; risk executive function; risk management; risk management framework; threat intelligence; threat modelling; security assessment report; security control; security plan; senior agency information security officer; senior agency official for privacy; system development life cycle; system owner; system privacy officer; system security officer.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis publication was developed by the Joint Task Force Interagency Working Group.

An effective monitoring strategy at the system level is developed and implemented in coordination with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy early in the system development life cycle (i.e., during system design or COTS procurement decision). The system-level monitoring strategy supplements the organizational monitoring strategy—that is, the system-level strategy addresses monitoring only the security and privacy controls for which monitoring is not provided as part of the organizational strategy and implementation. The system-level monitoring strategy identifies the frequency of monitoring for security and privacy controls not addressed by the organizational strategy and defines the approach for assessing those controls. The system-level strategy, consistent with the organizational strategy, may also define how changes to the system are to be monitored, how security and privacy impact analyses are to be conducted, and the security and privacy status reporting requirements including recipients of the status reports. The system level monitoring strategy can be included in security and privacy plans. \n\nFor implemented security and privacy controls not addressed by the organizational monitoring strategy, the criteria for determining the frequency with which controls are monitored post-deployment is established by the system owner or common control provider in collaboration with organizational officials including, for example, the authorizing official or designated representative; chief information officer; senior agency information security officer; senior agency official for privacy; and senior accountable official for risk management/risk executive (function). The frequency criteria at the system level reflect the priorities and the importance of the system to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Security and privacy controls that are volatile (i.e., most likely to change over time), critical to certain aspects of the protection strategy for the organization, or identified in plans of action and milestones may require more frequent assessment. The approach to security and privacy control assessments during continuous monitoring may include detection of the status of system components; analysis of historical and operational data; and the reuse of assessment procedures and results that supported the initial authorization decision.\n\nThe authorizing official or designated representative approves the system-level monitoring strategy including the minimum frequency with which each security and privacy control is to be monitored. The approval of the strategy can be obtained in conjunction with the security and privacy plan approval. The monitoring of security and privacy controls continues throughout the system development life cycle.\n\nReferences:  NIST Special']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

It consists of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purposes and supports the organization's missions and business processes. Each system element is implemented to fulfill specified requirements including security and privacy requirements. The term 'system' can be applied across a continuum from composed elements to a discrete element, and its context must be communicated and understood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ['of accuracy. Therefore, the responsibility and accountability for the security of the system cannot be assigned. Each system consists of a set of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purposes and supporting the organization’s missions and business processes. Each system element is implemented to fulfill specified requirements including security and privacy requirements. System elements include human elements, technology/machine elements, and physical/environmental elements. System elements are implemented via hardware, software, or firmware; physical structures or devices; or people, processes, and procedures.\n\nFor a large or complex system, a system element may be regarded as a system and will itself be composed of system elements. The hierarchical and context-dependent nature of the terms system and system element allows the term system to be used when referring to a discrete component or a complex, geographically distributed system-of-systems. Because the term system can be applied across a continuum from composed elements to a discrete element, the context in which the term system is being used must be communicated and understood. The term system-of-interest is used to define the set of system elements, system element interconnections, and the environment that is the focus of the RMF implementation. For systems processing personally identifiable information, it is essential that privacy and security programs collaborate to develop a common and shared understanding of the system boundary. Privacy risks arise from the processing of PII, which may occur outside of what the security program typically considers the system boundary.

NIST continues to work with both public and private sector entities to establish mappings and relationships between its information security standards and guidelines and those developed by external organizations.\n\n\n\nCOMMON SECURITY FOUNDATIONS\n\nIn developing standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with federal agencies, state, local, and tribal governments, and private sector organizations to improve information security; avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort; and ensure that its publications are complementary with the standards and guidelines used for the protection of national security systems. In addition to a comprehensive and transparent public review and vetting process, NIST is engaged in a collaborative partnership with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Department of Defense, and Committee on National Security Systems, and has established a risk management framework for the federal government. This common foundation for security provides the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence Communities of the federal government and their contractors, more cost-effective, flexible, and consistent methods to manage security risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The unified framework also provides a strong basis for reciprocal acceptance of authorization decisions and facilitates information sharing and collaboration. NIST continues to work with both public and private sector entities to establish mappings and relationships between its information security standards and guidelines and those developed by external organizations.\n\n\n\n\nMANAGING INFORMATION SECURITY RISK\n\nUsing the Cybersecurity Framework\n\nExecutive Order (E.O.) 13800 requires federal agencies to modernize their IT infrastructure and systems, and recognizes the increasing interconnectedness of federal information systems and networks. The E.O. also requires agency heads to manage risk at the agency level and across the Executive Branch using the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (also known as the Cybersecurity Framework) developed by NIST. And finally, the E.O. reinforces the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 by holding agency heads accountable for managing the cybersecurity risk to their enterprises.\n\nThe Cybersecurity Framework is adaptive to provide a flexible and risk-based implementation that can be used with a broad array of cybersecurity risk management processes. Therefore, consistent with OMB Memorandum M-17-25, the federal implementation of the Cybersecurity Framework will employ the risk management processes defined in NIST Special Publications 800-39 and 800-37. This will allow agencies to meet']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

NIST continues to work with both public and private sector entities to establish mappings and relationships between its information security standards and guidelines and those developed by external organizations.\n\n\n\nCOMMON SECURITY FOUNDATIONS\n\nIn developing standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with federal agencies, state, local, and tribal governments, and private sector organizations to improve information security; avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort; and ensure that its publications are complementary with the standards and guidelines used for the protection of national security systems. In addition to a comprehensive and transparent public review and vetting process, NIST is engaged in a collaborative partnership with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Department of Defense, and Committee on National Security Systems, and has established a risk management framework for the federal government. This common foundation for security provides the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence Communities of the federal government and their contractors, more cost-effective, flexible, and consistent methods to manage security risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The unified framework also provides a strong basis for reciprocal acceptance of authorization decisions and facilitates information sharing and collaboration. NIST continues to work with both public and private sector entities to establish mappings and relationships between its information security standards and guidelines and those developed by external organizations.\n\n\n\n\nMANAGING INFORMATION SECURITY RISK\n\nUsing the Cybersecurity Framework\n\nExecutive Order (E.O.) 13800 requires federal agencies to modernize their IT infrastructure and systems, and recognizes the increasing interconnectedness of federal information systems and networks. The E.O. also requires agency heads to manage risk at the agency level and across the Executive Branch using the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (also known as the Cybersecurity Framework) developed by NIST. And finally, the E.O. reinforces the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 by holding agency heads accountable for managing the cybersecurity risk to their enterprises.\n\nThe Cybersecurity Framework is adaptive to provide a flexible and risk-based implementation that can be used with a broad array of cybersecurity risk management processes. Therefore, consistent with OMB Memorandum M-17-25, the federal implementation of the Cybersecurity Framework will employ the risk management processes defined in NIST Special Publications 800-39 and 800-37. This will allow agencies to meet']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

A system may need to process PII in whole or in part of its life cycle to achieve its mission or business function. While the mission or business function is expected to provide benefits, an unintended consequence of the PII processing is the potential for individuals to experience privacy-related problems depending on how the processing is accomplished. The objective of a privacy risk assessment and subsequent selection and implementation of privacy controls is to minimize the likelihood and/or the impact of creating privacy-related problems, while maximizing the benefits or utility of the PII processing for the mission or business function.\n\nIdentifying the life cycle of PII through a data map enables organizations to know how PII is being processed or where individuals are interacting with the system so that they can better assess where privacy risks could arise and privacy controls can be applied most effectively.

As part of the risk assessment, stakeholder assets are prioritized based on the adverse consequence of asset loss. The meaning of loss is defined for each stakeholder asset to enable a determination of loss consequence (i.e., the adverse impact of the loss). Loss consequences constitute a continuum that spans from partial loss to total loss relative to the asset. The consequence of losing an asset is determined relative to the concerns of the stakeholders. Interpretations of data loss may include loss of possession, destruction, or loss of precision or accuracy. The loss of a function or service may be interpreted as a loss of control, loss of accessibility, loss of the ability to deliver normal function, performance, or behavior, or a limited loss of capability resulting in a level of degradation of function, performance, or behavior. Prioritization of assets is based on the stakeholder assessment of acceptance of the adverse consequence of loss. This is reflected in terms of asset value, criticality, cost of replacement, impact on image or reputation, or trust by users, by mission or business partners, or by collaborating organizations. The asset priority translates to precedence in allocating resources, determining strength of mechanisms, and defining levels of assurance. Asset valuation is a precondition for defining stakeholder protection needs and security requirements.\n\nAnother aspect of risk assessment is the determination of asset susceptibility to adversity and uncertainty. Adversity includes all forms of potential disruptions, threats, and hazards across all human, physical, technology/machine, and environmental forms throughout the system’s life cycle. Adversity consists of those events and preexisting or emergent conditions that combine to produce the loss of assets and the associated adverse consequences to stakeholders. Adversity comes in malicious and non-malicious forms and can emanate from a variety of sources including, for example, simple or sophisticated attacks (i.e., cyber, electronic, supply chain, physical, social); human error (i.e., commission or omission); abuse and misuse; accidents and incidents; component fault or failure; and natural or man-made disasters. The identification and assessment of adversity characterizes the events and conditions that are anticipated throughout the life cycle of the system and correlates those events and conditions to the asset loss concerns of stakeholders. The correlation of asset susceptibility to adversity with loss consequence considers what is known, what is possible, what is likely,']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

| What are the seven steps of the NIST RMF?                                                                                     | The given context does not explicitly mention the exact number of steps in the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). However, it implies that the document discusses several steps associated with the RMF. By observing the provided list, it appears that there are at least eight steps in the RMF: CATEGORIZE, ASSESS, AUTHORIZE, MONITOR, PREPARE, IMPLEMENT, SELECT, and CATEGORIZE (again). These steps may be repeated or have specific sub-steps not mentioned.

| What is a 'Framework Profile' in the context of the NIST CSF?                                                                 | In the context of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), a 'Framework Profile' refers to an organization's specific instantiation of the NIST CSF, which reflects their unique cybersecurity risk profile, business requirements, and processes. This profile helps organizations align their current practices with the desired outcomes defined by the five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover, thus enabling them to manage cybersecurity-related risks more effectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ['NIST Cybersecurity Framework Policy Template Guide\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive template for organizations seeking to assess their compliance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

| According to the NIST CSF Audit survey, what should an organization have in place regarding its supply chain risk management? | According to the provided document, an organization should have a system in place that reviews and updates its risk management strategy at least quarterly, or as required, to discuss, prioritize, address, and monitor identified risks. This includes security risks within the context of supply chain risk management.

| What is the primary output of the RMF 'Select' step?                                                                          | The provided context does not explicitly detail the primary output of the 'Select' step in the Risk Management Framework (RMF). However, it can be inferred that the 'Select' step involves making a choice or decision based on the information gathered during the previous steps. Therefore, one possible answer could be that the primary output of the 'Select' step is a selected action or strategy to mitigate identified risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ['Figure 3 illustrates the steps in the RMF.

Once the system is in the operations and maintenance phase of the system development life cycle as part of the continuous monitoring step, events may dictate nonsequential execution.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Tangible assets are physical in nature and include the physical elements of the environment of operation (e.g.,']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| What is the purpose of 'Protective Technology' as outlined in the CSF audit template?                                         | Protective Technology, as outlined in the given CSF audit template, appears to be implemented for the purpose of ensuring both physical protection and environmental protection. This is inferable from the context that there seems to exist a policy related to these areas within the provided document.

| What is the purpose of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) as described in the SP 800-37r2 draft?                             | The Risk Management Framework (RMF), as described in the SP 800-37r2 draft, is designed to provide guidelines for applying a structured and flexible process to information systems and organizations. This process includes activities like organizational asset valuation, security and privacy control selection, implementation, assessment, system and control authorizations, and continuous monitoring. The RMF also includes enterprise-level activities to help prepare organizations for executing the framework at the system level.

| What is the main objective of the 'Prepare' step in the RMF?                                                                  | The main objective of the 'Prepare' step in the Risk Management Framework (RMF) appears to be to prepare the organization to execute the RMF effectively, efficiently, and cost-effectively. This includes a wide range of activities that may extend beyond security-related tasks but are crucial for achieving adequate security and managing risk appropriately. The context does not explicitly mention specific activities at Level 1 or Level 2 in detail, but they seem to be critical to this preparation process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ['optimization, and standardization (i.e., reducing the attack surface and technology footprint exploitable by adversaries);

This suggests that under such conditions, the AO's role might evolve to include continuous oversight and approval of security measures in a near real-time manner.

| What does the audit template ask regarding an organization's incident response capabilities?                                  | The audit template asks about several aspects of an organization's incident response capabilities. It inquires if there is an incident response policy and procedures for incident response planning. Additionally, it seeks to determine whether all information system security incidents are tracked, documented, and reported, including non-reportable incidents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ["Is there an incident response policy?\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there procedures for incident response planning?

| What is the purpose of 'Protective Technology' as outlined in the CSF audit template?                                         | Protective Technology, as outlined in the CSF (Cybersecurity Framework) Audit Template, refers to the systems and practices put in place to safeguard an organization's physical and environmental assets. These may include measures for power management, door access control, temperature regulation, and humidity maintenance among others. The frequency of monitoring these aspects is defined by the organization itself. However, the specific purpose of each aspect within the context of 'Protective Technology' can be inferred from their functions. For instance, power management ensures uninterrupted operation of systems, door access control secures physical premises, and temperature and humidity controls maintain optimal conditions for equipment operation and data storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ['Is there a physical and environmental protection policy?
