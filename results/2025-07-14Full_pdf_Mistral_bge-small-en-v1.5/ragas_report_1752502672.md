This report is not intended to provide \nan exhaustive survey of all available literature on Adversarial ML, which includes \nmore than 11,354 references on arXiv.org since 2021 as of July 2024. \nThis report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems. Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques. The intent is to raise awareness of open questions in the \nfield of AML and to call attention to trends that may shape risk and risk management \npractices in future. \n3']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

The guide also includes suggested types of \nanalysis that IGs may perform to assess capabilities in given areas.  The guide should be \nconsidered for suggested source evidence that IGs may request to answer a metric.  The guide \nshould not be considered as an all-inclusive list of source evidence or test methods to reach the \nvarious maturity levels within metrics and domains.  The test methods are not all inclusive and \nmay not apply in all situations.

Backdoor attacks are the only attacks in the literature that require both training \nand testing data control. Model poisoning attacks could result in either targeted or back-\ndoor attacks, and the attacker modifies model parameters to cause an integrity violation. \nThey have been designed for centralized learning [222] and federated learning [22, 36]. \nPrivacy compromise [NISTAML.03] [Back to Index]. A PRIVACY COMPROMISE attack causes \nthe unintended leakage of restricted or proprietary information from a PredAI system, in-\ncluding details about a model’s training data, weights, or architecture [100, 309]. While \nthe term “confidentiality” is more widely used in taxonomies of traditional cybersecurity \nattacks, the AML field has tended to use the top-level term “privacy” to encompass both \nattacks against the confidentiality of a model (e.g., those that extract information about a \nmodel’s weights or architecture) and those that cause violations of expected privacy prop-\nerties of model outputs (e.g. by exposing model training data) [310]. DATA CONFIDENTIAL-\nITY during ML training can be achieved through secure computation methods based on \ncryptographic techniques [2, 253, 288, 385], which ensure that training data and model \nparameters remain protected during the training phase. However, even models trained \nusing paradigms that enforce data confidentiality may be vulnerable to privacy attacks, in \nwhich adversaries interacting with a model can extract information about its training data \nor parameters. In this report, we focus on privacy compromises that can occur at deploy-\nment time, regardless of the training method used, or whether data confidentiality was \nmaintained during training. \nIn privacy attacks, attackers might be interested in learning information about the training \ndata (resulting in DATA PRIVACY ATTACKS) or the ML model (resulting in MODEL PRIVACY AT-\nTACKS).'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Examples include data reconstruction, membership-inference attacks, training data extraction, attribute inference attacks, and property inference.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |       0        |           0.726469 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

These challenges span different phases of ML operations such \nas the potential for adversarial manipulation of training data; the provision of adversar-\nial inputs to adversely affect the performance of the AI system; and even malicious ma-\nnipulations, modifications, or interactions with models to exfiltrate sensitive information \nfrom the model’s training data or to which the model has access. Such attacks have been \ndemonstrated under real-world conditions, and their sophistication and impacts have been \nincreasing steadily. \nThe field of AML is concerned with studying these attacks.

It is also concerned \nwith the design of ML algorithms and systems that can withstand these security and privacy \nchallenges, a property often known as robustness [274]. \nTo taxonimize these attacks, this report differentiates between predictive and generative \nAI systems and the attacks relevant to each. It considers the components of an AI system \nincluding the data; the model itself; the processes for training, testing, and deploying the \nmodel; and the broader software and system contexts into which models may be embed-\nded, such as cases where Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models are deployed \nwith access to private data or equipped with tools to take actions with real-world conse-\nquences.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

In GenAI moreso than in PredAI, different activities such as data col-\nlection, model training, model deployment, and application development are often carried \nout by multiple different organizations or actors. \nFor example, a common paradigm in GenAI is the use of a smaller number of foundation \nmodels to support a diverse range of downstream applications. Foundation models are \npre-trained on large-scale data using self-supervised learning in order to encode general \npatterns in text, images, or other data that may be relevant for many different applica-\ntions [311]. Data at the scale used in foundation models is often collected from a variety \nof internet sources (which attackers can target, such as in DATA POISONING attacks). \nThis generalist learning paradigm equips foundation models with a variety of capabilities \nand tendencies — many of which are desirable, but some of which may be harmful or \nunwanted by the model developer . Techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and \nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can be used after initial pre-training \nto better align the base model with human preferences and to curb undesirable or harmful \nmodel outputs [281] (see Fig. 3).'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The GenAI Stages of Learning are pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and reinforcement learning from human feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       0.8      |           0.845729 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

Several adver-\nsarial attack classification frameworks have been introduced in prior works [42, 358], and \nthe goal here is to create a standard terminology for adversarial attacks on ML that unifies \nexisting work. \n2.1.1. Stages  of Learning \nPredictiv\ne machine learning involves a TRAINING STAGE in which a model is learned and \na DEPLOYMENT STAGE in which the model is deployed on new, unlabeled data samples to \ngenerate predictions. In the case of SUPERVISED LEARNING, labeled training data is given as \ninput to a training algorithm in the training stage, and the ML model is optimized to mini-\nmize a specific loss function. Validation and testing of the ML model is usually performed \nbefore the model is deployed in the real world. Common supervised learning techniques \ninclude CLASSIFICATION in which the predicted labels or classes are discrete and REGRESSION \nin which the predicted labels or response variables are continuous. \nOther learning paradigms in the ML literature include UNSUPERVISED LEARNING, which trains \nmodels using unlabeled data at training time; SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING in which a small \nset of examples have labels, while the majority of samples are unlabeled; REINFORCEMENT \nLEARNING in which an agent interacts with an environment and learns an optimal policy \nto maximize its reward; FEDERATED LEARNING in which a set of clients jointly train an ML \nmodel by communicating with a server that performs an aggregation of model updates; \nand ENSEMBLE LEARNING, which is an approach that seeks better predictive performance by \ncombining the predictions from multiple models. \nMost PredAI models are DISCRIMINATIVE, i.e., learn only a decision boundary, such as LOGIS-\nTIC REGRESSION, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, and CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS. GenAI \nmodels may also be used in predictive tasks, such as sentiment analysis [125] .']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

| Describe the Ad Hoc maturity level.                                                                                                                                                     | In the provided context, there's no explicit definition of the "Ad Hoc" maturity level. However, it can be inferred that this term is associated with the maturity model for assessing the effectiveness of information security programs. The Ad Hoc level likely refers to the initial stage or foundational level where agencies are developing sound policies and procedures for their information security programs. This is based on the descriptions given for the other levels, where "Ad Hoc" would represent a lower level in comparison to the defined (level 2), consistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5) stages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ['“Can’t read?” I asked. “All those folks?”\n“That’s right,” Calpurnia nodded. “Can’t but about four folks in First Purchase \nread… I’m one of ‘em.”\n“Where’d you go to school, Cal?” asked Jem.\n“Nowhere. Let’s see now, who taught me my letters? It was Miss Maudie \nAtkinson’s aunt, old Miss Buford—”\n“Are you that old?”\n“I’m older than Mr. Finch, even.” Calpurnia grinned. “Not sure how much, \nthough.

Cal, did you teach Zeebo?”\n“Yeah, Mister Jem. There wasn’t a school even when he was a boy. I made him \nlearn, though.”\nZeebo was Calpurnia’s eldest son. If I had ever thought about it, I would have \nknown that Calpurnia was of mature years—Zeebo had half-grown children—but \nthen I had never thought about it.\n“Did you teach him out of a primer, like us?” I asked.\n“No, I made him get a page of the Bible every day, and there was a book Miss \nBuford taught me out of—bet you don’t know where I got it,” she said.\nWe didn’t know.\nCalpurnia said, “Your Granddaddy Finch gave it to me.”\n“Were you from the Landing?” Jem asked. “You never told us that.”\n“I certainly am, Mister Jem.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The Ad Hoc maturity level indicates that an organization has not defined formal processes, policies, or procedures for the specific cybersecurity activity being evaluated.                                                                                                                                                                              |       0.75     |           0.800969 |            0.5      |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.

If your father was thirty you’d find life quite \ndifferent.”\n“I sure would. Atticus can’t do anything…”\n“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”\n“What can he do?”\n“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”\n“Shoot…”\n“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town?

While cybersecurity and image clas-\nsifications were the first application domains to showcase evasion attacks, ML technology \nin many other application domains has come under scrutiny, including speech recogni-\ntion [66], natural language processing [185], and video classification [215, 401]. \nMitigating adversarial examples is a well-known challenge in the community and deserves \nadditional research and investigation. The field has a history of publishing defenses eval-\nuated under relatively weak adversarial models that are subsequently broken by more \npowerful attacks. Mitigations need to be evaluated against strong adaptive attacks, and \nguidelines for the rigorous evaluation of newly proposed mitigation techniques have been \nestablished [97, 375]. The most promising directions for mitigating the critical threat of \nevasion attacks are adversarial training [144, 232] (iteratively generating and inserting ad-\nversarial examples with their correct labels at training time); certified techniques, such as \n11']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age. If your father was thirty you’d find life quite \ndifferent.”\n“I sure would. Atticus can’t do anything…”\n“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”\n“What can he do?”\n“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”\n“Shoot…”\n“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town?

IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022.

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

Further, IGs should explain in CyberScope the impact this has on the IGs \nability to determine the effectiveness of their agency’s information security program.  \n \nTh\ne tables below show the IG metrics for FY25 IG evaluation period.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The OIG should consider closing the recommendation with a status of 'Unresolved - Closed' and, if appropriate, issue an updated and refocused recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                            |       0.8      |           0.966793 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

OFIs and IMCs could \nbecome recommendations over time (generally 1-2 years) if the POA&Ms or OFIs and IMCs are \nnot timely resolved.   \n \nH\now should OIGs and agencies agree and keep recommendation remediation plans up-to-\ndate? \nOrdinarily, OIGs and Agency officials review and collaborate on recommendations to come to a \nmanagement decision.  This is either done through the agency’s official comments to the report \nor during recommendation follow-up.  During the management decision process it is critical that \nall parties are clear and agree upon the agency’s planned corrective action.  This is the time to \nensure that the planned corrective action meets the intent of the recommendation and the selected \nNIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 controls (or other applicable criteria).  A healthy back and \nforth conversation to come to an agreed upon planned corrective action will ensure that the \nimplemented corrective action also align.

However, these aspects seem to be implied or secondary, as they are not explicitly listed as six separate functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

| In the context of Generative AI, what is a 'jailbreak'?                                                                                                                                 | In the provided context, a "jailbreak" refers to a scenario where a model is manipulated or bypassed to produce output that was not intended by its designers, often used in the context of generative models. This can be achieved through various methods such as adaptive attacks, which interact with the model iteratively and eventually lead to a successful jailbreak against safety alignment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ['When the attacker has access to a high-quality classifier \nthat judges whether model output is harmful, it may be used as a reward function to \ntrain a generative model to generate jailbreaks of another generative model. Only \nquery access is required for each of the models, and no human intervention is re-\nquired to update or refine a candidate jailbreak. The prompts may also be transfer-\nable from the target model to other closed-source LLMs [73]. \nThe Crescendo attack [316] introduced the idea of interacting with the model itera-\ntively in a multi-turn adaptive attack that includes seemingly benign prompts, even-\ntually leading to a successful jailbreak against safety alignment. The initial manual \nattack is fully automated by leveraging another LLM for prompt generation and in-\ncorporating multiple input sources. \n45'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | A jailbreak is a direct prompting attack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as bypassing refusal behavior to enable misuse.                                                                                                                                                                                               |       0.857143 |           0.956305 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

The specific mitigation strategies against adversarial evasion attacks can be found within Section 2.2 of the report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nExecutive Summary \nThis NIST Trustworthy and Responsible AI report describes a taxonomy and terminology \nfor ADVERSARIAL MACHINE LEARNING (AML) that may aid in securing applications of artificial \nintelligence (AI) against adversarial manipulations and attacks. \nThe statistical, data-based nature of ML systems opens up new potential vectors for at-\ntacks against these systems’ security, privacy, and safety, beyond the threats faced by tra-\nditional software systems. These challenges span different phases of ML operations such \nas the potential for adversarial manipulation of training data; the provision of adversar-\nial inputs to adversely affect the performance of the AI system; and even malicious ma-\nnipulations, modifications, or interactions with models to exfiltrate sensitive information \nfrom the model’s training data or to which the model has access. Such attacks have been \ndemonstrated under real-world conditions, and their sophistication and impacts have been \nincreasing steadily. \nThe field of AML is concerned with studying these attacks. It must consider the capabilities \nof attackers, the model or system properties that attackers might seek to violate in pursuit \nof their objectives, and the design of attack methods that exploit vulnerabilities during the \ndevelopment, training, and deployment phases of the ML life cycle. It is also concerned \nwith the design of ML algorithms and systems that can withstand these security and privacy \nchallenges, a property often known as robustness [274]. \nTo taxonimize these attacks, this report differentiates between predictive and generative \nAI systems and the attacks relevant to each. It considers the components of an AI system \nincluding the data; the model itself; the processes for training, testing, and deploying the \nmodel; and the broader software and system contexts into which models may be embed-\nded, such as cases where Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models are deployed \nwith access to private data or equipped with tools to take actions with real-world conse-\nquences.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The three main classes of defenses against evasion attacks are adversarial training, randomized smoothing, and formal verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       0.666667 |           0        |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

This report is not intended to provide \nan exhaustive survey of all available literature on Adversarial ML, which includes \nmore than 11,354 references on arXiv.org since 2021 as of July 2024. \nThis report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems. Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques. The intent is to raise awareness of open questions in the \nfield of AML and to call attention to trends that may shape risk and risk management \npractices in future. \n3']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

He said Atticus never talked \nmuch about the Radleys: when Jem would question him Atticus’s only answer \nwas for him to mind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a \nright to; but when it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said, “Mm, \nmm, mm.”\nSo Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford, a \nneighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing. According to Miss \nStephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from The \nMaycomb Tribune to paste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr. \nRadley passed by, Boo drove the scissors into his parent’s leg, pulled them out, \nwiped them on his pants, and resumed his activities.\nMrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but \nwhen the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the \nTribune. He was thirty-three years old then.\nMiss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum, \nwhen it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo \nwasn’t crazy, he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr. \nRadley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not \na criminal. The sheriff hadn’t the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so \nBoo was locked in the courthouse basement.\nBoo’s transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jem’s memory. \nMiss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he \ndidn’t take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could \nnot live forever on the bounty of the county.\nNobody knew what form of intimidation Mr.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Arthur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     nan        |           0        |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

I believe he already knows you.”\nIf Atticus could blandly introduce me to Boo Radley at a time like this, well—that \nwas Atticus.\nBoo saw me run instinctively to the bed where Jem was sleeping, for the same shy \nsmile crept across his face. Hot with embarrassment, I tried to cover up by \ncovering Jem up.\n“Ah-ah, don’t touch him,” Atticus said.\nMr. Heck Tate sat looking intently at Boo through his horn-rimmed glasses. He \nwas about to speak when Dr. Reynolds came down the hall.\n“Everybody out,” he said, as he came in the door. “Evenin‘, Arthur, didn’t notice \nyou the first time I was here.”\nDr. Reynolds’s voice was as breezy as his step, as though he had said it every \nevening of his life, an announcement that astounded me even more than being in \nthe same room with Boo Radley. Of course… even Boo Radley got sick \nsometimes, I thought. But on the other hand I wasn’t sure.\nDr. Reynolds was carrying a big package wrapped in newspaper. He put it down \non Jem’s desk and took off his coat. “You’re quite satisfied he’s alive, now? Tell \nyou how I knew. When I tried to examine him he kicked me. Had to put him out \ngood and proper to touch him. So scat,” he said to me.\n“Er—” said Atticus, glancing at Boo. “Heck, let’s go out on the front porch. \nThere are plenty of chairs out there, and it’s still warm enough.”\nI wondered why Atticus was inviting us to the front porch instead of the \nlivingroom, then I understood.

When we went home, Jem put the dolls in his trunk.\nLess than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum, which we \nenjoyed, the fact that everything on the Radley Place was poison having slipped \nJem’s memory.\nThe following week the knot-hole yielded a tarnished medal. Jem showed it to \nAtticus, who said it was a spelling medal, that before we were born the Maycomb \nCounty schools had spelling contests and awarded medals to the winners. Atticus \nsaid someone must have lost it, and had we asked around? Jem camel-kicked me \nwhen I tried to say where we had found it. Jem asked Atticus if he remembered \nanybody who ever won one, and Atticus said no.\nOur biggest prize appeared four days later. It was a pocket watch that wouldn’t \nrun, on a chain with an aluminum knife.\n“You reckon it’s white gold, Jem?”\n“Don’t know. I’ll show it to Atticus.”\nAtticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars, knife, chain and all, if it were \nnew. “Did you swap with somebody at school?” he asked.\n“Oh, no sir!” Jem pulled out his grandfather’s watch that Atticus let him carry \nonce a week if Jem were careful with it. On the days he carried the watch, Jem \nwalked on eggs. “Atticus, if it’s all right with you, I’d rather have this one instead. \nMaybe I can fix it.”\nWhen the new wore off his grandfather’s watch, and carrying it became a day’s \nburdensome task, Jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every \nfive minutes.\nHe did a fair job, only one spring and two tiny pieces left over, but the watch \nwould not run. “Oh-h,” he sighed, “it’ll never go.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | They found chewing gum, two polished Indian-head pennies, a ball of gray twine, two soap dolls carved to look like them, a tarnished spelling medal, and a broken pocket watch with a chain and aluminum knife.                                                                                                                                          |     nan        |           0.951949 |            1        |         0.666667 | sentence_splitter   |

I followed him. “Hasn’t passed by yet,” he said.\nNext day Jem repeated his vigil and was rewarded.\n“Hidy do, Mr. Nathan,” he said.\n“Morning Jem, Scout,” said Mr. Radley, as he went by.\n“Mr. Radley,” said Jem.\nMr. Radley turned around.\n“Mr. Radley, ah—did you put cement in that hole in that tree down yonder?”\n“Yes,” he said. “I filled it up.”\n“Why’d you do it, sir?”\n“Tree’s dying. You plug ‘em with cement when they’re sick. You ought to know \nthat, Jem.”\nJem said nothing more about it until late afternoon. When we passed our tree he \ngave it a meditative pat on its cement, and remained deep in thought. He seemed \nto be working himself into a bad humor, so I kept my distance.\nAs usual, we met Atticus coming home from work that evening. When we were at \nour steps Jem said, “Atticus, look down yonder at that tree, please sir.”\n“What tree, son?”\n“The one on the corner of the Radley lot comin‘ from school.”\n“Yes?”\n“Is that tree dyin‘?”\n“Why no, son, I don’t think so. Look at the leaves, they’re all green and full, no \nbrown patches anywhere—”\n“It ain’t even sick?”\n“That tree’s as healthy as you are, Jem. Why?”\n“Mr. Nathan Radley said it was dyin‘.”\n“Well maybe it is. I’m sure Mr. Radley knows more about his trees than we do.”\nAtticus left us on the porch.

Thanks, Heck.”\n“Atticus, is Jem dead?”']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

He had been lying on the grass. “You \nlittle folks won’t tell on me now, will you? It’d ruin my reputation if you did.”\n“You mean all you drink in that sack’s Coca-Cola? Just plain Coca-Cola?”\n“Yes ma’am,” Mr. Raymond nodded. I liked his smell: it was of leather, horses, \ncottonseed. He wore the only English riding boots I had ever seen. “That’s all I \ndrink, most of the time.”\n“Then you just pretend you’re half—? I beg your pardon, sir,” I caught myself. “I \ndidn’t mean to be—”\nMr. Raymond chuckled, not at all offended, and I tried to frame a discreet \nquestion: “Why do you do like you do?”\n“Wh—oh yes, you mean why do I pretend? Well, it’s very simple,” he said. \n“Some folks don’t—like the way I live. Now I could say the hell with ‘em, I don’t \ncare if they don’t like it. I do say I don’t care if they don’t like it, right enough—\nbut I don’t say the hell with ’em, see?”\nDill and I said, “No sir.”\n“I try to give ‘em a reason, you see. It helps folks if they can latch onto a reason. \nWhen I come to town, which is seldom, if I weave a little and drink out of this \nsack, folks can say Dolphus Raymond’s in the clutches of whiskey—that’s why \nhe won’t change his ways.

Jem said it might work if I \ncried and flung a fit, being young and a girl. That didn’t work either. But when he \nnoticed us dragging around the neighborhood, not eating, taking little interest in \nour normal pursuits, Atticus discovered how deeply frightened we were. He \ntempted Jem with a new football magazine one night; when he saw Jem flip the \npages and toss it aside, he said, “What’s bothering you, son?”\nJem came to the point: “Mr. Ewell.”\n“What has happened?”\n“Nothing’s happened. We’re scared for you, and we think you oughta do \nsomething about him.”\nAtticus smiled wryly. “Do what? Put him under a peace bond?”\n“When a man says he’s gonna get you, looks like he means it.”\n“He meant it when he said it,” said Atticus. “Jem, see if you can stand in Bob \nEwell’s shoes a minute. I destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he \nhad any to begin with. The man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind \nalways does. So if spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewell \none extra beating, that’s something I’ll gladly take. He had to take it out on \nsomebody and I’d rather it be me than that houseful of children out there. You \nunderstand?”\nJem nodded.\nAunt Alexandra entered the room as Atticus was saying, “We don’t have anything \nto fear from Bob Ewell, he got it all out of his system that morning.”\n“I wouldn’t be so sure of that, Atticus,” she said. “His kind’d do anything to pay \noff a grudge. You know how those people are.”\n“What on earth could Ewell do to me, sister?”\n“Something furtive,” Aunt Alexandra said.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Arthur 'Boo' Radley.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     nan        |           0        |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

When it healed, and Jem’s fears of never being able to play football were \nassuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was \nsomewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand \nwas at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn’t have \ncared less, so long as he could pass and punt.\nWhen enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we \nsometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells \nstarted it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before \nthat. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea \nof making Boo Radley come out.\nI said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing, it really began with Andrew \nJackson.

| Describe the 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level for the metric regarding an organization's inventory of information systems.                                                     | The 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level refers to a state where an organization consistently applies its defined policies, procedures, and processes to manage the cybersecurity risks associated with maintaining its information systems. This includes performing system risk assessments according to defined timeframes, implementing appropriate security controls to mitigate identified risks, using a common vulnerability scoring system or similar approach for communicating characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities, and managing risks through a cybersecurity risk register among other practices. However, it's important to note that this level does not imply the inventory of information systems is always comprehensive and accurate, but rather that the established processes are consistently followed to maintain that inventory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ['25 \n \nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL \nAssessor Best Practices \nDefined:   \n \nConsistently Implemented:   \n \nManaged and measurable:   \n \nOptimized:    \n \nRisk and Asset Management (RAM) \n7.

On the other hand, a black-box attack assumes minimal or no knowledge about the ML system, with only query access to the model and no additional information about its training process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nto evaluate potential mitigations. This definition is more general and encompasses the no-\ntion of adaptive attacks in which knowledge of the mitigations applied to the model or the \nsystem is explicitly tracked. \nBlack-box attacks. These attacks assume that the attacker operates with minimal, and \nsometimes no knowledge at all about the ML system. An adversary might have query \naccess to the model, but they have no other information about how the model is trained. \nThese attacks are the most practical since they assume that the attacker has no knowledge \nof the AI system and utilizes system interfaces readily available for normal use. \nGray-box attacks. There are a range of gray-box attacks that capture adversarial knowl-\nedge between black-box and white-box attacks. Suciu et al. [358] introduced a framework \nto classify gray-box attacks. An attacker might know the model architecture but not its pa-\nrameters, or the attacker might know the model and its parameters but not the training \ndata. Other common assumptions for gray-box attacks are that the attacker has access to \ndata distributed identically to the training data and knows the feature representation. The \nlatter assumption is important for applications in which feature extraction is used before \ntraining an ML model, such as cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. \n2.1.5. Data Mo dality \nUntil r\necently, most attacks and defenses in adversarial machine learning have operated \nunder a single modality, but a new trend in the field is to use multimodal data. The tax-\nonomy of attacks defined in Fig. 1 is independent of the modality of the data in specific \napplications. \nThe most common data modalities in the AML literature include: \n• Image: Adversarial examples of image data [144, 362] have the advantage of a con-\ntinuous domain, and gradient-based methods can be applied directly for optimiza-\ntion. Backdoor poisoning attacks were first invented for images [148], and many \nprivacy attacks are run on image datasets (e.g., [342]).'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | A white-box attack assumes the attacker has full knowledge of the machine learning system, including training data and architecture.

Each child assumes different roles in the story, with Dill often playing villainous characters, Scout taking on various ladies' roles, and Jem portraying a hero. The game is woven from bits of gossip and neighborhood legend about the mysterious Radley family, specifically focusing on Boo Radley. They use their imagination to add dialogue and plot to the game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ['and sweep the porch. Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up and down the \nsidewalk and coughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally, was Boo: he went \nunder the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time.\nAs the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected it, added \ndialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang \nchanges every day.\nDill was a villain’s villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and \nappear tall if height was part of the devilry required. He was as good as his worst \nperformance; his worst performance was Gothic. I reluctantly played assorted \nladies who entered the script. I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I \nplayed that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jem’s assurances that \nBoo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in \nthe daytime and Atticus home at night.\nJem was a born hero.\nIt was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and \nneighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr. \nRadley and lost all her money. She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her \nright forefinger (Dill’s contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldn’t find \nany cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the \ntime, while Boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house.\nThe three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for a \nchange; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with \nthe brushbroom.

A small patch of earth beneath its branches was packed hard from many \nfights and furtive crap games.\nThe lights in the high school auditorium were blazing in the distance, but they \nblinded us, if anything. “Don’t look ahead, Scout,” Jem said. “Look at the ground \nand you won’t fall.”\n“You should have brought the flashlight, Jem.”\n“Didn’t know it was this dark. Didn’t look like it’d be this dark earlier in the \nevening. So cloudy, that’s why. It’ll hold off a while, though.”\nSomeone leaped at us.\n“God almighty!” Jem yelled.\nA circle of light burst in our faces, and Cecil Jacobs jumped in glee behind it. “Ha-\na-a, gotcha!” he shrieked. “Thought you’d be comin‘ along this way!”\n“What are you doin‘ way out here by yourself, boy? Ain’t you scared of Boo \nRadley?”\nCecil had ridden safely to the auditorium with his parents, hadn’t seen us, then \nhad ventured down this far because he knew good and well we’d be coming \nalong. He thought Mr. Finch’d be with us, though.\n“Shucks, ain’t much but around the corner,” said Jem. “Who’s scared to go \naround the corner?” We had to admit that Cecil was pretty good, though. He had \ngiven us a fright, and he could tell it all over the schoolhouse, that was his \nprivilege.\n“Say,” I said, “ain’t you a cow tonight? Where’s your costume?”\n“It’s up behind the stage,” he said. “Mrs. Merriweather says the pageant ain’t \ncomin‘ on for a while. You can put yours back of the stage by mine, Scout, and \nwe can go with the rest of ’em.”\nThis was an excellent idea, Jem thought.

| Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23.                                                      | In Chapter 23, Jem initially believes that there are four kinds of folks in Maycomb County - ordinary people like them and their neighbors, the Cunninghams, the Ewells, and the Negroes. He explains that their kind of folks don't like the Cunninghams, the Cunninghams don't like the Ewells, and the Ewells hate and despise the colored folks. However, when Scout questions why Tom's jury, made up of folks like the Cunninghams, did not acquit Tom to spite the Ewells, Jem seems to reconsider his initial categorization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ['Jem.”\n“Well then, how do you explain why the Cunninghams are different? Mr. Walter \ncan hardly sign his name, I’ve seen him. We’ve just been readin‘ and writin’ \nlonger’n they have.”\n“No, everybody’s gotta learn, nobody’s born knowin‘. That Walter’s as smart as \nhe can be, he just gets held back sometimes because he has to stay out and help \nhis daddy. Nothin’s wrong with him. Naw, Jem, I think there’s just one kind of \nfolks. Folks.”\nJem turned around and punched his pillow. When he settled back his face was \ncloudy. He was going into one of his declines, and I grew wary. His brows came \ntogether; his mouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while.\n“That’s what I thought, too,” he said at last, “when I was your age. If there’s just \none kind of folks, why can’t they get along with each other? If they’re all alike, \nwhy do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I’m \nbeginning to understand something. I think I’m beginning to understand why Boo \nRadley’s stayed shut up in the house all this time… it’s because he wants to stay \ninside.”\nContents - Prev / Next\nChapter 24\nCalpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron.

Jem had discovered with \nangry amazement that nobody had ever bothered to teach Dill how to swim, a'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Jem believes there are four kinds of folks, separated by class and race (e.g., ordinary like the Finches, Cunninghams, Ewells, and Negroes), and that background is determined by how long a family has been literate.

He propped himself \nagainst a pillow and switched on the reading light. “You know something, Scout? \nI’ve got it all figured out, now. I’ve thought about it a lot lately and I’ve got it \nfigured out. There’s four kinds of folks in the world. There’s the ordinary kind \nlike us and the neighbors, there’s the kind like the Cunninghams out in the woods, \nthe kind like the Ewells down at the dump, and the Negroes.”\n“What about the Chinese, and the Cajuns down yonder in Baldwin County?”\n“I mean in Maycomb County. The thing about it is, our kind of folks don’t like \nthe Cunninghams, the Cunninghams don’t like the Ewells, and the Ewells hate \nand despise the colored folks.”\nI told Jem if that was so, then why didn’t Tom’s jury, made up of folks like the \nCunninghams, acquit Tom to spite the Ewells?“\nJem waved my question away as being infantile.\n“You know,” he said, “I’ve seen Atticus pat his foot when there’s fiddlin‘ on the \nradio, and he loves pot liquor better’n any man I ever saw—”\n“Then that makes us like the Cunninghams,” I said. “I can’t see why Aunty—”\n“No, lemme finish—it does, but we’re still different somehow. Atticus said one \ntime the reason Aunty’s so hipped on the family is because all we’ve got’s \nbackground and not a dime to our names.”\n“Well Jem, I don’t know—Atticus told me one time that most of this Old Family \nstuff’s foolishness because everybody’s family’s just as old as everybody else’s. I \nsaid did that include the colored folks and Englishmen and he said yes.”\n“Background doesn’t mean Old Family,” said Jem. “I think it’s how long your \nfamily’s been readin‘ and writin’.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

He suggests that this is what sets them apart from others, even though they share some similarities with other groups like the Cunninghams due to their love for music and certain food preferences. Scout also challenges Jem's initial categorization by pointing out that Atticus said most of the 'Old Family' stuff is foolishness because everybody's family is as old as everybody else's, including colored folks and Englishmen. This indicates a shift in Jem's view on what makes 'folks' different from one another, focusing more on education and cultural differences rather than arbitrary categorizations based on race or social status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | In the provided context, Aunt Alexandra does not explicitly define "fine folks." However, she indicates that there is a distinction between people being good and them being part of her or Scout's kind.

I can’t stay here all day \nwith you, and the summer’s going to be a hot one.”\n“Yes sir,” I said, not understanding a word he said. I had an idea, however, that \nAunt Alexandra’s appearance on the scene was not so much Atticus’s doing as \nhers. Aunty had a way of declaring What Is Best For The Family, and I suppose \nher coming to live with us was in that category.\nMaycomb welcomed her. Miss Maudie Atkinson baked a Lane cake so loaded \nwith shinny it made me tight; Miss Stephanie Crawford had long visits with Aunt \nAlexandra, consisting mostly of Miss Stephanie shaking her head and saying, \n“Uh, uh, uh.” Miss Rachel next door had Aunty over for coffee in the afternoons, \nand Mr. Nathan Radley went so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was \nglad to see her.\nWhen she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, Aunt Alexandra \nseemed as if she had always lived with us. Her Missionary Society refreshments \nadded to her reputation as a hostess (she did not permit Calpurnia to make the \ndelicacies required to sustain the Society through long reports on Rice Christians); \nshe joined and became Secretary of the Maycomb Amanuensis Club. To all \nparties present and participating in the life of the county, Aunt Alexandra was one \nof the last of her kind: she had river-boat, boarding-school manners; let any moral \ncome along and she would uphold it; she was born in the objective case; she was \nan incurable gossip.

This report is not intended to provide \nan exhaustive survey of all available literature on Adversarial ML, which includes \nmore than 11,354 references on arXiv.org since 2021 as of July 2024. \nThis report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems. Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques.

In Data Privacy Attacks, an attacker might try to learn information about the training data (e.g., Data Reconstruction), while in Model Privacy Attacks, an attacker may aim to gain insights into the model itself (e.g., extracting information about a model’s weights or architecture).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nwhich is added to both the poisoned samples and the testing samples to cause misclassi-\nfication. Backdoor attacks are the only attacks in the literature that require both training \nand testing data control. Model poisoning attacks could result in either targeted or back-\ndoor attacks, and the attacker modifies model parameters to cause an integrity violation. \nThey have been designed for centralized learning [222] and federated learning [22, 36]. \nPrivacy compromise [NISTAML.03] [Back to Index]. A PRIVACY COMPROMISE attack causes \nthe unintended leakage of restricted or proprietary information from a PredAI system, in-\ncluding details about a model’s training data, weights, or architecture [100, 309]. While \nthe term “confidentiality” is more widely used in taxonomies of traditional cybersecurity \nattacks, the AML field has tended to use the top-level term “privacy” to encompass both \nattacks against the confidentiality of a model (e.g., those that extract information about a \nmodel’s weights or architecture) and those that cause violations of expected privacy prop-\nerties of model outputs (e.g. by exposing model training data) [310]. DATA CONFIDENTIAL-\nITY during ML training can be achieved through secure computation methods based on \ncryptographic techniques [2, 253, 288, 385], which ensure that training data and model \nparameters remain protected during the training phase. However, even models trained \nusing paradigms that enforce data confidentiality may be vulnerable to privacy attacks, in \nwhich adversaries interacting with a model can extract information about its training data \nor parameters. In this report, we focus on privacy compromises that can occur at deploy-\nment time, regardless of the training method used, or whether data confidentiality was \nmaintained during training. \nIn privacy attacks, attackers might be interested in learning information about the training \ndata (resulting in DATA PRIVACY ATTACKS) or the ML model (resulting in MODEL PRIVACY AT-\nTACKS). The attacker could have different objectives for compromising the privacy of train-\ning data, such as DATA RECONSTRUCTION [110] (inferring the content or features of train-\ning data), MEMBERSHIP-INFERENCE'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Examples include data reconstruction, membership-inference attacks, training data extraction, attribute inference attacks, and property inference.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |       0.666667 |           0.878642 |            1        |         1        | token_text_splitter |

These challenges span different phases of ML operations such \nas the potential for adversarial manipulation of training data; the provision of adversar-\nial inputs to adversely affect the performance of the AI system; and even malicious ma-\nnipulations, modifications, or interactions with models to exfiltrate sensitive information \nfrom the model’s training data or to which the model has access. Such attacks have been \ndemonstrated under real-world conditions, and their sophistication and impacts have been \nincreasing steadily. \nThe field of AML is concerned with studying these attacks. It must consider the capabilities \nof attackers, the model or system properties that attackers might seek to violate in pursuit \nof their objectives, and the design of attack methods that exploit vulnerabilities during the \ndevelopment, training, and deployment phases of the ML life cycle. It is also concerned \nwith the design of ML algorithms and systems that can withstand these security and privacy \nchallenges, a property often known as robustness [274]. \nTo taxonimize these attacks, this report differentiates between predictive and generative \nAI systems and the attacks relevant to each. It considers the components of an AI system \nincluding the data; the model itself; the processes for training, testing, and deploying the \nmodel; and the broader software and system contexts into which models may be embed-\nded, such as cases where Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models are deployed \nwith access to private data or equipped with tools to take actions with real-world conse-\nquences. \nThus, the attacks within this taxonomy are classified relative to: (i) the AI system type, (ii) \nthe stage of the ML life cycle process in which the attack is mounted, (iii) the attacker’s \ngoals and objectives in terms']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

In GenAI moreso than in PredAI, different activities such as data col-\nlection, model training, model deployment, and application development are often carried \nout by multiple different organizations or actors. \nFor example, a common paradigm in GenAI is the use of a smaller number of foundation \nmodels to support a diverse range of downstream applications. Foundation models are \npre-trained on large-scale data using self-supervised learning in order to encode general \npatterns in text, images, or other data that may be relevant for many different applica-\ntions [311]. Data at the scale used in foundation models is often collected from a variety \nof internet sources (which attackers can target, such as in DATA POISONING attacks). \nThis generalist learning paradigm equips foundation models with a variety of capabilities \nand tendencies — many of which are desirable, but some of which may be harmful or \nunwanted by the model developer . Techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and \nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can be used after initial pre-training \nto better align the base model with human preferences and to curb undesirable or harmful \nmodel outputs [281] (see Fig. 3). However, these interventions can later be targeted using \nAML techniques by attackers seeking to recover or re-enable potentially harmful'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The GenAI Stages of Learning are pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and reinforcement learning from human feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       1        |           0.848897 |            1        |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

Several adver-\nsarial attack classification frameworks have been introduced in prior works [42, 358], and \nthe goal here is to create a standard terminology for adversarial attacks on ML that unifies \nexisting work. \n2.1.1. Stages  of Learning \nPredictiv\ne machine learning involves a TRAINING STAGE in which a model is learned and \na DEPLOYMENT STAGE in which the model is deployed on new, unlabeled data samples to \ngenerate predictions. In the case of SUPERVISED LEARNING, labeled training data is given as \ninput to a training algorithm in the training stage, and the ML model is optimized to mini-\nmize a specific loss function. Validation and testing of the ML model is usually performed \nbefore the model is deployed in the real world. Common supervised learning techniques \ninclude CLASSIFICATION in which the predicted labels or classes are discrete and REGRESSION \nin which the predicted labels or response variables are continuous. \nOther learning paradigms in the ML literature include UNSUPERVISED LEARNING, which trains \nmodels using unlabeled data at training time; SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING in which a small \nset of examples have labels, while the majority of samples are unlabeled; REINFORCEMENT \nLEARNING in which an agent interacts with an environment and learns an optimal policy \nto maximize its reward; FEDERATED LEARNING in which a set of clients jointly train an ML \nmodel by communicating with a server that performs an aggregation of model updates; \nand ENSEMBLE LEARNING, which is an approach that seeks better predictive performance by \ncombining the predictions from multiple models. \nMost PredAI models are DISCRIMINATIVE, i.e., learn only a decision boundary, such as LOGIS-\nTIC REGRESSION, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, and CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS. GenAI \nmodels may also be used in predictive tasks, such as sentiment analysis [125] . \nAML literature predominantly considers adversarial attacks against AI systems that could \noccur at either the training stage or the deployment stage.

They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age. If your father was thirty you’d find life quite \ndifferent.”\n“I sure would. Atticus can’t do anything…”\n“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”\n“What can he do?”\n“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”\n“Shoot…”\n“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town?

Meth-\nods for creating adversarial examples in black-box settings include zeroth-order optimiza-\ntion [80], discrete optimization [254], Bayesian optimization [344], and transferability, which \ninvolves the white-box generation of adversarial examples on a different model before \ntransferring them to the target model [282, 283, 377]. While cybersecurity and image clas-\nsifications were the first application domains to showcase evasion attacks, ML technology \nin many other application domains has come under scrutiny, including speech recogni-\ntion [66], natural language processing [185], and video classification [215, 401]. \nMitigating adversarial examples is a well-known challenge in the community and deserves \nadditional research and investigation. The field has a history of publishing defenses eval-\nuated under relatively weak adversarial models that are subsequently broken by more \npowerful attacks. Mitigations need to be evaluated against strong adaptive attacks, and \nguidelines for the rigorous evaluation of newly proposed mitigation techniques have been \nestablished [97, 375]. The most promising directions for mitigating the critical threat of \nevasion attacks are adversarial training [144, 232] (iteratively generating and inserting ad-\nversarial examples with their correct labels at training time); certified techniques, such as \n11'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | An adversarial example is a modified testing sample that induces misclassification or misbehavior of a machine learning model at deployment time.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |       0.6      |           0.86483  |            1        |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age. If your father was thirty you’d find life quite \ndifferent.”\n“I sure would. Atticus can’t do anything…”\n“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”\n“What can he do?”\n“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”\n“Shoot…”\n“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town? Why, down at the \nLanding when we were coming up, Atticus Finch could beat everybody on both \nsides of the river.”'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | A Mockingbird.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     nan        |           0.875716 |            1        |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022.

The guide also includes suggested types of \nanalysis that IGs may perform to assess capabilities in given areas.  The guide should be \nconsidered for suggested source evidence that IGs may request to answer a metric.  The guide \nshould not be considered as an all-inclusive list of source evidence or test methods to reach the \nvarious maturity levels within metrics and domains.  The test methods are not all inclusive and \nmay not apply in all situations.  Additional sources such as penetration testing and red team \nassessment results may be effective sources of evidence for select metrics.  \n \nTh\ne “Assessor’s Best Practices” section has replaced the “Additional Notes” section this year.  \nThis section now breaks out the four maturity levels beyond Ad-Hoc to provide the assessor \nspecific evaluation steps to consider for consistent assessment and testing.

As a general best practice, broad recommendations should be \navoided.  Recommendations should be focused on specific actions to address the root cause and \nlead the agency to that next maturity level.  It may require several recommendations to get that \nmetric to the next level, however this provides the agency with specific guidance and the \nopportunity to make steady and visible progress.  This approach would also allow the assessors \nto follow-up on agency actions taken as part of their recommendation follow-up processes and/or \nthe next FISMA evaluation.  It is a matter of opinion, however generally a higher quantity of \nspecific recommendations is preferable over fewer broad recommendations.  \n \nH\now should agencies consider plans of action and milestone (POA&M)? \nAs part of the data collection process, it is recommended that assessors collect and consider open \nPOA&Ms that the organization has self-identified (or other means, such as past GAO or OIG \nreports, or assessment and authorization reviews) as issues they are working to resolve.  As a \nbest practice, assessors should avoid issuing recommendations that the organization is aware of \nand actively working to resolve.  To re-emphasize the open POA&M assessors should consider \nreferencing them in the narrative write up.  Another potential approach would be to issue an \n“Opportunity for Improvement” (OFI) or an “Item for Management’s Consideration” (IMC) to \nstate that the organization should prioritize the POA&M in order to continue to mature the \nmetric, domain, or program.  OFIs and IMCs would be an “unofficial” recommendation that']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| What are the six cybersecurity functions that Inspectors General use to determine an agency's effectiveness?                                                                            | Based on the provided context, it appears that the Inspectors General (IG) may utilize several criteria to evaluate an agency's cybersecurity effectiveness.

| What are the two broad classes of AI systems distinguished in the NIST AI 100-2e2025 report?                                                                                            | The text does not provide explicit information about two broad classes of AI systems distinguished in the NIST AI 100-2e2025 report. However, it is possible to infer that the report focuses on the conceptual hierarchy of Machine Learning (ML) methods and life cycle stages of attacks related to Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). Therefore, one can assume that the broad classes might be categorized as ML methods (traditional machine learning or deep learning, reinforcement learning, etc.) and AML attack types (data poisoning, evasion, privacy breach, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ['How to Read This Document \nThis document uses the terms “AI technology,” “AI system,” and “AI applications” inter-\nchangeably.

The taxonomy is arranged in a \nconceptual hierarchy that includes key types of ML methods, life cycle stages of attack, and attacker \ngoals, objectives, capabilities, and knowledge. This report also identifies current challenges in the life \ncycle of AI systems and describes corresponding methods for mitigating and managing the \nconsequences of those attacks. The terminology used in this report is consistent with the literature on \nAML and is complemented by a glossary of key terms associated with the security of AI systems. Taken \ntogether, the taxonomy and terminology are meant to inform other standards and future practice guides \nfor assessing and managing the security of AI systems by establishing a common language for the \nrapidly developing AML landscape. \nKeywords \nartificial intelligence; machine learning; attack taxonomy; abuse; data poisoning; evasion; privacy \nbreach; attack mitigation; large language model; chatbot. \nNIST Trustworthy and Responsible AI \nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) promotes U.S. innovation and industrial \ncompetitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance \neconomic security and improve our quality of life.

Only \nquery access is required for each of the models, and no human intervention is re-\nquired to update or refine a candidate jailbreak. The prompts may also be transfer-\nable from the target model to other closed-source LLMs [73]. \nThe Crescendo attack [316] introduced the idea of interacting with the model itera-\ntively in a multi-turn adaptive attack that includes seemingly benign prompts, even-\ntually leading to a successful jailbreak against safety alignment. The initial manual \nattack is fully automated by leveraging another LLM for prompt generation and in-\ncorporating multiple input sources. \n45'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | A jailbreak is a direct prompting attack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as bypassing refusal behavior to enable misuse.                                                                                                                                                                                               |     nan        |           0.993317 |            1        |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

It would be best to refer to the original document for more detailed information about the defense strategies against adversarial evasion attacks according to the NIST AI report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nExecutive Summary \nThis NIST Trustworthy and Responsible AI report describes a taxonomy and terminology \nfor ADVERSARIAL MACHINE LEARNING (AML) that may aid in securing applications of artificial \nintelligence (AI) against adversarial manipulations and attacks. \nThe statistical, data-based nature of ML systems opens up new potential vectors for at-\ntacks against these systems’ security, privacy, and safety, beyond the threats faced by tra-\nditional software systems. These challenges span different phases of ML operations such \nas the potential for adversarial manipulation of training data; the provision of adversar-\nial inputs to adversely affect the performance of the AI system; and even malicious ma-\nnipulations, modifications, or interactions with models to exfiltrate sensitive information \nfrom the model’s training data or to which the model has access. Such attacks have been \ndemonstrated under real-world conditions, and their sophistication and impacts have been \nincreasing steadily. \nThe field of AML is concerned with studying these attacks. It must consider the capabilities \nof attackers, the model or system properties that attackers might seek to violate in pursuit \nof their objectives, and the design of attack methods that exploit vulnerabilities during the \ndevelopment, training, and deployment phases of the ML life cycle. It is also concerned \nwith the design of ML algorithms and systems that can withstand these security and privacy \nchallenges, a property often known as robustness [274]. \nTo taxonimize these attacks, this report differentiates between predictive and generative \nAI systems and the attacks relevant to each. It considers the components of an AI system \nincluding the data; the model itself; the processes for training, testing, and deploying the \nmodel; and the broader software and system contexts into which models may be embed-\nded, such as cases where Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models are deployed \nwith access to private data or equipped with tools to take actions with real-world conse-\nquences. \nThus, the attacks within this taxonomy are classified relative to: (i) the AI system type, (ii) \nthe stage of the ML life cycle process in which the attack is mounted, (iii) the attacker’s \ngoals and objectives in terms'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The three main classes of defenses against evasion attacks are adversarial training, randomized smoothing, and formal verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       0.8      |           0        |            0.5      |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

This report is not intended to provide \nan exhaustive survey of all available literature on Adversarial ML, which includes \nmore than 11,354 references on arXiv.org since 2021 as of July 2024. \nThis report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems. Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques. The intent is to raise awareness of open questions in the \nfield of AML and to call attention to trends that may shape risk and risk management \npractices in future. \n3']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

When we went home, Jem put the dolls in his trunk.\nLess than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum, which we \nenjoyed, the fact that everything on the Radley Place was poison having slipped \nJem’s memory.\nThe following week the knot-hole yielded a tarnished medal. Jem showed it to \nAtticus, who said it was a spelling medal, that before we were born the Maycomb \nCounty schools had spelling contests and awarded medals to the winners. Atticus \nsaid someone must have lost it, and had we asked around? Jem camel-kicked me \nwhen I tried to say where we had found it. Jem asked Atticus if he remembered \nanybody who ever won one, and Atticus said no.\nOur biggest prize appeared four days later. It was a pocket watch that wouldn’t \nrun, on a chain with an aluminum knife.\n“You reckon it’s white gold, Jem?”\n“Don’t know. I’ll show it to Atticus.”\nAtticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars, knife, chain and all, if it were \nnew. “Did you swap with somebody at school?” he asked.\n“Oh, no sir!” Jem pulled out his grandfather’s watch that Atticus let him carry \nonce a week if Jem were careful with it. On the days he carried the watch, Jem \nwalked on eggs. “Atticus, if it’s all right with you, I’d rather have this one instead. \nMaybe I can fix it.”\nWhen the new wore off his grandfather’s watch, and carrying it became a day’s \nburdensome task, Jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every \nfive minutes.\nHe did a fair job, only one spring and two tiny pieces left over, but the watch \nwould not run. “Oh-h,” he sighed, “it’ll never go. Scout—?”\n“Huh?”\n“You reckon we oughta write a letter to whoever’s leaving us these things?”\n“That’d be right nice, Jem, we can thank ‘em—what’s wrong?”\nJem was holding his'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | They found chewing gum, two polished Indian-head pennies, a ball of gray twine, two soap dolls carved to look like them, a tarnished spelling medal, and a broken pocket watch with a chain and aluminum knife.                                                                                                                                          |     nan        |           0.945379 |            1        |         0.666667 | token_text_splitter |

When we passed our tree he \ngave it a meditative pat on its cement, and remained deep in thought. He seemed \nto be working himself into a bad humor, so I kept my distance.\nAs usual, we met Atticus coming home from work that evening. When we were at \nour steps Jem said, “Atticus, look down yonder at that tree, please sir.”\n“What tree, son?”\n“The one on the corner of the Radley lot comin‘ from school.”\n“Yes?”\n“Is that tree dyin‘?”\n“Why no, son, I don’t think so. Look at the leaves, they’re all green and full, no \nbrown patches anywhere—”\n“It ain’t even sick?”\n“That tree’s as healthy as you are, Jem. Why?”\n“Mr. Nathan Radley said it was dyin‘.”\n“Well maybe it is. I’m sure Mr. Radley knows more about his trees than we do.”\nAtticus left us on the porch. Jem leaned on a pillar, rubbing his shoulders against \nit.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age. If your father was thirty you’d find life quite \ndifferent.”\n“I sure would. Atticus can’t do anything…”\n“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”\n“What can he do?”\n“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”\n“Shoot…”\n“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town? Why, down at the \nLanding when we were coming up, Atticus Finch could beat everybody on both \nsides of the river.”']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

He had been lying on the grass. “You \nlittle folks won’t tell on me now, will you? It’d ruin my reputation if you did.”\n“You mean all you drink in that sack’s Coca-Cola? Just plain Coca-Cola?”\n“Yes ma’am,” Mr. Raymond nodded. I liked his smell: it was of leather, horses, \ncottonseed. He wore the only English riding boots I had ever seen. “That’s all I \ndrink, most of the time.”\n“Then you just pretend you’re half—? I beg your pardon, sir,” I caught myself. “I \ndidn’t mean to be—”\nMr. Raymond chuckled, not at all offended, and I tried to frame a discreet \nquestion: “Why do you do like you do?”\n“Wh—oh yes, you mean why do I pretend? Well, it’s very simple,” he said. \n“Some folks don’t—like the way I live. Now I could say the hell with ‘em, I don’t \ncare if they don’t like it. I do say I don’t care if they don’t like it, right enough—\nbut I don’t say the hell with ’em, see?”\nDill and I said, “No sir.”\n“I try to give ‘em a reason, you see. It helps folks if they can latch onto a reason. \nWhen I come to town, which is seldom, if I weave a little and drink out of this \nsack, folks can say Dolphus Raymond’s in the clutches of whiskey—that’s why \nhe won’t change his ways.

Put him under a peace bond?”\n“When a man says he’s gonna get you, looks like he means it.”\n“He meant it when he said it,” said Atticus. “Jem, see if you can stand in Bob \nEwell’s shoes a minute. I destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he \nhad any to begin with. The man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind \nalways does. So if spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewell \none extra beating, that’s something I’ll gladly take. He had to take it out on \nsomebody and I’d rather it be me than that houseful of children out there. You \nunderstand?”\nJem nodded.\nAunt Alexandra entered the room as Atticus was saying, “We don’t have anything \nto fear from Bob Ewell, he got it all out of his system that morning.”\n“I wouldn’t be so sure of that, Atticus,” she said. “His kind’d do anything to pay \noff a grudge. You know how those people are.”\n“What on earth could Ewell do to me, sister?”\n“Something furtive,” Aunt Alexandra said. “You may count on that.”\n“Nobody has much chance to be furtive'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Arthur 'Boo' Radley.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       1        |           0        |            0.5      |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

When it healed, and Jem’s fears of never being able to play football were \nassuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was \nsomewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand \nwas at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn’t have \ncared less, so long as he could pass and punt.\nWhen enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we \nsometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells \nstarted it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before \nthat. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea \nof making Boo Radley come out.\nI said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing, it really began with Andrew \nJackson. If General Jackson hadn’t run the Creeks up the creek, Simon Finch \nwould never have paddled up the Alabama, and where would we be if he hadn’t?']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

That is an advertisement.”\nCecil Jacobs knew what one was, though. When his turn came, he went to the \nfront of the room and began, “Old Hitler—”\n“Adolf Hitler, Cecil,” said Miss Gates. “One never begins with Old anybody.”\n“Yes ma’am,” he said. “Old Adolf Hitler has been prosecutin‘ the—”\n“Persecuting Cecil…”\n“Nome, Miss Gates, it says here—well anyway, old Adolf Hitler has been after \nthe Jews and he’s puttin‘ ’em in prisons and he’s taking away all their property \nand he won’t let any of ‘em out of the country and he’s washin’ all the feeble-\nminded and—”\n“Washing the feeble-minded?”\n“Yes ma’am, Miss Gates, I reckon they don’t have sense enough to wash \nthemselves, I don’t reckon an idiot could keep hisself clean. Well anyway, \nHitler’s started a program to round up all the half-Jews too and he wants to \nregister ‘em in case they might wanta cause him any trouble and I think this is a \nbad thing and that’s my current event.”\n“Very good, Cecil,” said Miss Gates. Puffing, Cecil returned to his seat.\nA hand went up in the back of the room. “How can he do that?”\n“Who do what?” asked Miss Gates patiently.\n“I mean how can Hitler just put a lot of folks in a pen like that, looks like the \ngovamint’d stop him,” said the owner of the hand.\n“Hitler is the government,” said Miss Gates, and seizing an opportunity to make \neducation dynamic, she went to the blackboard.

This includes regular system risk assessments, the implementation of appropriate security controls, and the use of a cybersecurity risk register to manage identified risks. Evidence of consistent implementation may include system registration and inventory process directives, system interconnect inventory processes and procedures, information security program policies and procedures, risk executive council charters, risk council meeting minutes, organizational, mission, and system-level risk assessments, system security plans, security assessment reports, system risk assessments, system categorization documents/worksheets, cybersecurity framework profiles, risk registers/Cybersecurity risk registers (CSRRs), risk detail records (RDRs), risk heat maps, POA&Ms, project plans/taskers, and risk council/steering committee meeting minutes. | ['25 \n \nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL \nAssessor Best Practices \nDefined:   \n \nConsistently Implemented:   \n \nManaged and measurable:   \n \nOptimized:    \n \nRisk and Asset Management (RAM) \n7.

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | A white-box attack assumes the attacker has full knowledge about the Machine Learning (ML) system, including details like the model architecture and its parameters, as well as the training data. On the other hand, a black-box attack operates with minimal or no information about the ML system. The attacker may have query access to the model but does not know how it was trained or any additional details. In essence, a white-box attack involves more comprehensive knowledge compared to a black-box attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ['to follow instructions with human feedback.

This definition is more general and encompasses the no-\ntion of adaptive attacks in which knowledge of the mitigations applied to the model or the \nsystem is explicitly tracked. \nBlack-box attacks. These attacks assume that the attacker operates with minimal, and \nsometimes no knowledge at all about the ML system. An adversary might have query \naccess to the model, but they have no other information about how the model is trained. \nThese attacks are the most practical since they assume that the attacker has no knowledge \nof the AI system and utilizes system interfaces readily available for normal use. \nGray-box attacks. There are a range of gray-box attacks that capture adversarial knowl-\nedge between black-box and white-box attacks. Suciu et al. [358] introduced a framework \nto classify gray-box attacks. An attacker might know the model architecture but not its pa-\nrameters, or the attacker might know the model and its parameters but not the training \ndata. Other common assumptions for gray-box attacks are that the attacker has access to \ndata distributed identically to the training data and knows the feature representation. The \nlatter assumption is important for applications in which feature extraction is used before \ntraining an ML model, such as cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. \n2.1.5. Data Mo dality \nUntil r\necently, most attacks and defenses in adversarial machine learning have operated \nunder a single modality, but a new trend in the field is to use multimodal data. The tax-\nonomy of attacks defined in Fig. 1 is independent of the modality of the data in specific \napplications. \nThe most common data modalities in the AML literature include: \n• Image: Adversarial examples of image data [144, 362] have the advantage of a con-\ntinuous domain, and gradient-based methods can be applied directly for optimiza-\ntion. Backdoor poisoning attacks were first invented for images [148], and many \nprivacy attacks are run on image datasets (e.g., [342]). The image modality includes \nother types of imaging (e.g., LIDAR, SAR, IR, hyperspectral). \n• Text: Text is']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

The game is called 'Boo Radley', with each character assuming different roles. Jem plays Boo and sneaks into the Radley house to steal scissors or cut up newspapers in a secretive manner, while Dill acts as a villain who tries to confront Jem. The game includes elements of drama, dialogue, and various characters, such as sheriffs, townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford. They would also pause their activities when any neighbors appeared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ['and sweep the porch. Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up and down the \nsidewalk and coughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally, was Boo: he went \nunder the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time.\nAs the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected it, added \ndialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang \nchanges every day.\nDill was a villain’s villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and \nappear tall if height was part of the devilry required. He was as good as his worst \nperformance; his worst performance was Gothic. I reluctantly played assorted \nladies who entered the script. I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I \nplayed that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jem’s assurances that \nBoo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in \nthe daytime and Atticus home at night.\nJem was a born hero.\nIt was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and \nneighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr. \nRadley and lost all her money.

| Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23.                                                      | In Chapter 23, both Jem and Scout express their thoughts about why certain people behave differently towards each other despite being essentially the same. Initially, Jem believes that there may be only one kind of people if they are all alike, but he wonders why they cannot get along with each other. Later, Jem suggests that he is beginning to understand something; he thinks he's starting to comprehend why Boo Radley has stayed isolated for so long - because he chooses to remain indoors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ['Jem.”\n“Well then, how do you explain why the Cunninghams are different? Mr. Walter \ncan hardly sign his name, I’ve seen him. We’ve just been readin‘ and writin’ \nlonger’n they have.”\n“No, everybody’s gotta learn, nobody’s born knowin‘. That Walter’s as smart as \nhe can be, he just gets held back sometimes because he has to stay out and help \nhis daddy. Nothin’s wrong with him. Naw, Jem, I think there’s just one kind of \nfolks. Folks.”\nJem turned around and punched his pillow. When he settled back his face was \ncloudy. He was going into one of his declines, and I grew wary. His brows came \ntogether; his mouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while.\n“That’s what I thought, too,” he said at last, “when I was your age. If there’s just \none kind of folks, why can’t they get along with each other? If they’re all alike, \nwhy do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I’m \nbeginning to understand something. I think I’m beginning to understand why Boo \nRadley’s stayed shut up in the house all this time… it’s because he wants to stay \ninside.”\nContents - Prev / Next\nChapter 24\nCalpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron.

The discrepancy in their views becomes evident when Jem voices concern about Scout's tendency to act impulsively towards others if her pride is at stake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | In the provided context, Aunt Alexandra doesn't explicitly define 'Fine Folks'. However, she indirectly refers to them when she speaks about the handful of people in Maycomb who say a fair trial is for everybody, not just them, and those with enough humility to think that "the Negro but for the Lord’s kindness am I." This implies that Aunt Alexandra considers these individuals as 'Fine Folks' or morally superior ones because they advocate for fairness and empathy towards others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ['I said I would like it very much, which was a lie, but one must lie under certain \ncircumstances and at all times when one can’t do anything about them.\n“We felt it was time you children needed—well, it’s like this, Scout,” Atticus \nsaid. “Your aunt’s doing me a favor as well as you all. I can’t stay here all day \nwith you, and the summer’s going to be a hot one.”\n“Yes sir,” I said, not understanding a word he said. I had an idea, however, that \nAunt Alexandra’s appearance on the scene was not so much Atticus’s doing as \nhers. Aunty had a way of declaring What Is Best For The Family, and I suppose \nher coming to live with us was in that category.\nMaycomb welcomed her. Miss Maudie Atkinson baked a Lane cake so loaded \nwith shinny it made me tight; Miss Stephanie Crawford had long visits with Aunt \nAlexandra, consisting mostly of Miss Stephanie shaking her head and saying, \n“Uh, uh, uh.” Miss Rachel next door had Aunty over for coffee in the afternoons, \nand Mr. Nathan Radley went so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was \nglad to see her.\nWhen she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, Aunt Alexandra \nseemed as if she had always lived with us. Her Missionary Society refreshments \nadded to her reputation as a hostess (she did not permit Calpurnia to make the \ndelicacies required to sustain the Society through long reports on Rice Christians); \nshe joined and became Secretary of the Maycomb Amanuensis Club. To all \nparties present and participating in the life of the county, Aunt Alexandra was one \nof the last of her kind: she had river-boat, boarding-school manners; let any moral \ncome along and she would uphold it; she was born in the objective case; she was \nan incurable gossip. When Aunt Alexandra went to school, self-doubt could not \nbe found in any textbook, so she knew not its meaning.

She looked weary. She spoke, and her voice was flat.\n“I can’t say I approve of everything he does, Maudie, but he’s my brother, and I \njust want to know when this will ever end.” Her voice rose: “It tears him to \npieces. He doesn’t show it much, but it tears him to pieces. I’ve seen him when—\nwhat else do they want from him, Maudie, what else?”\n“What does who want, Alexandra?” Miss Maudie asked.\n“I mean this town. They’re perfectly willing to let him do what they’re too afraid \nto do themselves—it might lose ‘em a nickel.

This understanding seems to contrast slightly with Aunt Alexandra's definition, as Scout includes the aspect of courage and standing up against injustice when defining 'Fine Folks'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques. The intent is to raise awareness of open questions in the \nfield of AML and to call attention to trends that may shape risk and risk management \npractices in future. \n3 ']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

These include Data Privacy Attacks (resulting from learning information about the training data), Model Privacy Attacks (attempts to extract information about the model itself), and various specific types of Data Privacy Attacks such as Data Reconstruction, Membership-Inference Attack, Training Data Extraction, Attribute Inference Attacks, and Property Inference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nwhich is added to both the poisoned samples and the testing samples to cause misclassi-\nfication. Backdoor attacks are the only attacks in the literature that require both training \nand testing data control. Model poisoning attacks could result in either targeted or back-\ndoor attacks, and the attacker modifies model parameters to cause an integrity violation. \nThey have been designed for centralized learning [222] and federated learning [22, 36]. \nPrivacy compromise [NISTAML.03] [Back to Index]. A PRIVACY COMPROMISE attack causes \nthe unintended leakage of restricted or proprietary information from a PredAI system, in-\ncluding details about a model’s training data, weights, or architecture [100, 309]. While \nthe term “confidentiality” is more widely used in taxonomies of traditional cybersecurity \nattacks, the AML field has tended to use the top-level term “privacy” to encompass both \nattacks against the confidentiality of a model (e.g., those that extract information about a \nmodel’s weights or architecture) and those that cause violations of expected privacy prop-\nerties of model outputs (e.g. by exposing model training data) [310]. DATA CONFIDENTIAL-\nITY during ML training can be achieved through secure computation methods based on \ncryptographic techniques [2, 253, 288, 385], which ensure that training data and model \nparameters remain protected during the training phase. However, even models trained \nusing paradigms that enforce data confidentiality may be vulnerable to privacy attacks, in \nwhich adversaries interacting with a model can extract information about its training data \nor parameters. In this report, we focus on privacy compromises that can occur at deploy-\nment time, regardless of the training method used, or whether data confidentiality was \nmaintained during training. \nIn privacy attacks, attackers might be interested in learning information about the training \ndata (resulting in DATA PRIVACY ATTACKS) or the ML model (resulting in MODEL PRIVACY AT-\nTACKS). The attacker could have different objectives for compromising the privacy of train-\ning data, such as DATA RECONSTRUCTION [110] (inferring the content or features of train-\ning data), MEMBERSHIP-INFERENCE ATTACK [162, 343] (inferring the presence of data in the \ntraining set), TRAINING DATA EXTRACTION [59, 63] (extracting training data from generative \nmodels), ATTRIBUTE INFERENCE ATTACKS [184, 409] (inferring sensitive attributes of training \nrecords) and PROPERTY INFERENCE [134] (inferring properties about the training data dis-\ntribution). MODEL EXTRACTION is a model privacy attack in which attackers aim to extract \ninformation about the model [177]. \n2.1.3.

These challenges span different phases of ML operations such \nas the potential for adversarial manipulation of training data; the provision of adversar-\nial inputs to adversely affect the performance of the AI system; and even malicious ma-\nnipulations, modifications, or interactions with models to exfiltrate sensitive information \nfrom the model’s training data or to which the model has access. Such attacks have been \ndemonstrated under real-world conditions, and their sophistication and impacts have been \nincreasing steadily. \nThe field of AML is concerned with studying these attacks. It must consider the capabilities \nof attackers, the model or system properties that attackers might seek to violate in pursuit \nof their objectives, and the design of attack methods that exploit vulnerabilities during the \ndevelopment, training, and deployment phases of the ML life cycle. It is also concerned \nwith the design of ML algorithms and systems that can withstand these security and privacy \nchallenges, a property often known as robustness [274]. \nTo taxonimize these attacks, this report differentiates between predictive and generative \nAI systems and the attacks relevant to each. It considers the components of an AI system \nincluding the data; the model itself; the processes for training, testing, and deploying the \nmodel; and the broader software and system contexts into which models may be embed-\nded, such as cases where Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models are deployed \nwith access to private data or equipped with tools to take actions with real-world conse-\nquences. \nThus, the attacks within this taxonomy are classified relative to: (i) the AI system type, (ii) \nthe stage of the ML life cycle process in which the attack is mounted, (iii) the attacker’s \ngoals and objectives in terms of the system properties they seek to violate, (iv) the at-\ntacker’s capabilities and access, and (v) the attacker’s knowledge of the learning process \nand beyond. \nThis report adopts the concepts of security, resilience, and robustness of ML systems from \nthe NIST AI Risk Management Framework. Security, resilience, and robustness are gauged \nby risk, which is a measure of the extent to which an entity (e.g., a system) is threatened by \na potential circumstance or event (e.g., an attack) and the severity of the outcome should \nsuch an event occur . However, this report does not make recommendations on risk toler-\nance (i.e., the level of risk that is acceptable to organizations or society) because it is highly \ncontextual and specific to applications and use cases. \n']                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Common supervised learning techniques \ninclude CLASSIFICATION in which the predicted labels or classes are discrete and REGRESSION \nin which the predicted labels or response variables are continuous. \nOther learning paradigms in the ML literature include UNSUPERVISED LEARNING, which trains \nmodels using unlabeled data at training time; SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING in which a small \nset of examples have labels, while the majority of samples are unlabeled; REINFORCEMENT \nLEARNING in which an agent interacts with an environment and learns an optimal policy \nto maximize its reward; FEDERATED LEARNING in which a set of clients jointly train an ML \nmodel by communicating with a server that performs an aggregation of model updates; \nand ENSEMBLE LEARNING, which is an approach that seeks better predictive performance by \ncombining the predictions from multiple models. \nMost PredAI models are DISCRIMINATIVE, i.e., learn only a decision boundary, such as LOGIS-\nTIC REGRESSION, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, and CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS. GenAI \nmodels may also be used in predictive tasks, such as sentiment analysis [125] . \nAML literature predominantly considers adversarial attacks against AI systems that could \noccur at either the training stage or the deployment stage. During the training stage, the \nattacker might control part of the training data, their labels, the model parameters, or \nthe code of ML algorithms, resulting in different types of poisoning attacks. During the \ndeployment stage, the ML model is already trained, and the adversary could mount evasion \nattacks to create integrity violations and change the ML model’s predictions, as well as \nprivacy attacks to infer sensitive information about the training data or the ML model. \nTraining-time attacks. POISONING ATTACKS [40] occur during the ML training stage. In a \nDATA POISONING attack [40, 148], an adversary controls a subset of the training data by \neither inserting or modifying training samples. In a MODEL POISONING attack [222], the \nadversary controls the model and its parameters. Data poisoning attacks are applicable \nto all learning paradigms, while model poisoning attacks are most prevalent in federated \nlearning [190], where clients send local model updates to the aggregating server, and in \nsupply-chain attacks, where malicious code may be added to the model by suppliers of \n5 '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The GenAI Stages of Learning are pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and reinforcement learning from human feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       1        |           0        |            0        |       nan        | semantic_splitter   |

Generative AI Taxonomy \nGenAI\n is a branch of AI that develops models that can generate content (e.g., images, \ntext, and other media) with similar properties to their training data. GenAI includes sev-\neral different types of AI technologies with distinct origins, modeling approaches, and re-\nlated properties, including: GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS, GENERATIVE PRE-TRAINED \nTRANSFORMER (GPT), and DIFFUSION MODELS, among others. Recently, GenAI systems have \nemerged with multi-modal content generation or comprehension capabilities [119], some-\ntimes through combining two or more model types. \n3.1. Attack Classification \nWhile\n many attack types in the PredAI taxonomy apply to GenAI (e.g., data poisoning, \nmodel poisoning, and model extraction), recent work has also introduced novel AML at-\ntacks specific to GenAI systems. \nFigure 2 shows a taxonomy of attacks in AML for GenAI systems. Similar to the PredAI \ntaxonomy in Fig. 1, this taxonomy is first categorized by the system properties that attackers \nseek to compromise in each case, including availability breakdowns, integrity violations, \nand privacy compromises, as well as the additional category of AML attack relevant to \nGenAI of misuse enablement, in which attackers seek to circumvent restrictions placed \non the outputs of GenAI systems (see Sec. 2.1.2).

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I?

| How does the NIST document define 'adversarial example'?                                                                                                                                | In the provided context, an 'adversarial example' is not directly defined. However, it is mentioned that Jia and Liang [185] developed a methodology for generating adversarial text examples. This suggests that in the document, an adversarial example could be understood as a manipulated or malicious text example. To find the actual definition of 'adversarial example', one would need to click on the word shown in small caps (e.g., ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLE) in the text, which leads directly to the glossary for its definition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ['• This document contains links shown in blue.

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old.

IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022.

The guide also includes suggested types of \nanalysis that IGs may perform to assess capabilities in given areas.  The guide should be \nconsidered for suggested source evidence that IGs may request to answer a metric.  The guide \nshould not be considered as an all-inclusive list of source evidence or test methods to reach the \nvarious maturity levels within metrics and domains.  The test methods are not all inclusive and \nmay not apply in all situations.  Additional sources such as penetration testing and red team \nassessment results may be effective sources of evidence for select metrics.  \n \nTh\ne “Assessor’s Best Practices” section has replaced the “Additional Notes” section this year.  \nThis section now breaks out the four maturity levels beyond Ad-Hoc to provide the assessor \nspecific evaluation steps to consider for consistent assessment and testing.

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

An \nenterprise is an organization by this definition, but it exists at the top level of the hierarchy where \nindividual senior leaders have unique risk management responsibilities (e.g., federal agency or '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | There are 20 core metrics that are assessed annually by the Inspectors General (IGs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     nan        |           0.953055 |            1        |       nan        | semantic_splitter   |

The guide also includes suggested types of \nanalysis that IGs may perform to assess capabilities in given areas.  The guide should be \nconsidered for suggested source evidence that IGs may request to answer a metric.  The guide \nshould not be considered as an all-inclusive list of source evidence or test methods to reach the \nvarious maturity levels within metrics and domains.  The test methods are not all inclusive and \nmay not apply in all situations.  Additional sources such as penetration testing and red team \nassessment results may be effective sources of evidence for select metrics.  \n \nTh\ne “Assessor’s Best Practices” section has replaced the “Additional Notes” section this year.  \nThis section now breaks out the four maturity levels beyond Ad-Hoc to provide the assessor \nspecific evaluation steps to consider for consistent assessment and testing.  The steps provided \nare ones that have been used by experienced assessors and align to the maturity level and criteria \nfor success. \n \nT\nhe guide is a companion document to the FY 2025 IG FISMA metrics1 and OMB M-25-042 \nwhich provides guidance to IGs to assist in their FISMA evaluations. \n \nD\netermining Effectiveness with IG Metrics  \nIGs are required to assess the effectiveness of information security programs on a maturity model \nspectrum, in which the foundational levels ensure that agencies develop sound policies and \nprocedures, and at the advanced levels capture the extent that agencies institutionalize those \npolicies and procedures.  The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

As a general best practice, broad recommendations should be \navoided.  Recommendations should be focused on specific actions to address the root cause and \nlead the agency to that next maturity level.  It may require several recommendations to get that \nmetric to the next level, however this provides the agency with specific guidance and the \nopportunity to make steady and visible progress.  This approach would also allow the assessors \nto follow-up on agency actions taken as part of their recommendation follow-up processes and/or \nthe next FISMA evaluation.  It is a matter of opinion, however generally a higher quantity of \nspecific recommendations is preferable over fewer broad recommendations.  \n \nH\now should agencies consider plans of action and milestone (POA&M)? \nAs part of the data collection process, it is recommended that assessors collect and consider open \nPOA&Ms that the organization has self-identified (or other means, such as past GAO or OIG \nreports, or assessment and authorization reviews) as issues they are working to resolve.  As a \nbest practice, assessors should avoid issuing recommendations that the organization is aware of \nand actively working to resolve.  To re-emphasize the open POA&M assessors should consider \nreferencing them in the narrative write up.  Another potential approach would be to issue an \n“Opportunity for Improvement” (OFI) or an “Item for Management’s Consideration” (IMC) to \nstate that the organization should prioritize the POA&M in order to continue to mature the \nmetric, domain, or program.  OFIs and IMCs would be an “unofficial” recommendation that the \nassessor can issue in the report that does not get tracked in monthly reports and semi-annual \nreports (SAR), but rather just goes on record to emphasize the issue.  OFIs and IMCs could \nbecome recommendations over time (generally 1-2 years) if the POA&Ms or OFIs and IMCs are \nnot timely resolved.   \n \nH\now should OIGs and agencies agree and keep recommendation remediation plans up-to-\ndate? \nOrdinarily, OIGs and Agency officials review and collaborate on recommendations to come to a \nmanagement decision.  This is either done through the agency’s official comments to the report \nor during recommendation follow-up.

These challenges span different phases of ML operations such \nas the potential for adversarial manipulation of training data; the provision of adversar-\nial inputs to adversely affect the performance of the AI system; and even malicious ma-\nnipulations, modifications, or interactions with models to exfiltrate sensitive information \nfrom the model’s training data or to which the model has access. Such attacks have been \ndemonstrated under real-world conditions, and their sophistication and impacts have been \nincreasing steadily. \nThe field of AML is concerned with studying these attacks. It must consider the capabilities \nof attackers, the model or system properties that attackers might seek to violate in pursuit \nof their objectives, and the design of attack methods that exploit vulnerabilities during the \ndevelopment, training, and deployment phases of the ML life cycle. It is also concerned \nwith the design of ML algorithms and systems that can withstand these security and privacy \nchallenges, a property often known as robustness [274]. \nTo taxonimize these attacks, this report differentiates between predictive and generative \nAI systems and the attacks relevant to each. It considers the components of an AI system \nincluding the data; the model itself; the processes for training, testing, and deploying the \nmodel; and the broader software and system contexts into which models may be embed-\nded, such as cases where Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models are deployed \nwith access to private data or equipped with tools to take actions with real-world conse-\nquences. \nThus, the attacks within this taxonomy are classified relative to: (i) the AI system type, (ii) \nthe stage of the ML life cycle process in which the attack is mounted, (iii) the attacker’s \ngoals and objectives in terms of the system properties they seek to violate, (iv) the at-\ntacker’s capabilities and access, and (v) the attacker’s knowledge of the learning process \nand beyond. \nThis report adopts the concepts of security, resilience, and robustness of ML systems from \nthe NIST AI Risk Management Framework. Security, resilience, and robustness are gauged \nby risk, which is a measure of the extent to which an entity (e.g., a system) is threatened by \na potential circumstance or event (e.g., an attack) and the severity of the outcome should \nsuch an event occur . However, this report does not make recommendations on risk toler-\nance (i.e., the level of risk that is acceptable to organizations or society) because it is highly \ncontextual and specific to applications and use cases. \n']                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

This can involve overriding the system prompt to cause the model to generate outputs that may be restricted or unsafe, or stealing the system instructions that have been carefully crafted for a specific use case (also known as prompt engineering). The concept of jailbreaking in generative AI is relevant when discussing the security vulnerabilities and potential attacks on these models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nFigure 5.

The DEPLOYMENT STAGE for GenAI models and systems varies both \nbased on how models are hosted or otherwise made available to users, and in how they \nare integrated into downstream applications. However, GenAI models and applications \noften share properties that leave them vulnerable to similar types of attacks. For example, \nunderlying many of the security vulnerabilities in LLM applications is the fact that data \nand instructions are not provided in separate channels to the LLM, which allows attackers \nto use data channels to inject malicious instructions in inference-time attacks (a similar \nflaw to that which underlies decades-old SQL injection attacks). Many of the attacks in \nthis stage are due to the following practices that are common in applications of text-based \ngenerative models: \n1. In-context instructions and system prompts: [NISTAML.035 ] [Back to Index] The \nbehavior of LLMs can be shaped through inference-time prompting, whereby the \ndeveloper or user provides in-context instructions that are often prepended to the \nmodel’s other input and context. These instructions comprise a natural language de-\nscription of the model’s application-specific use case (e.g., “You are a helpful finan-\ncial assistant who responds gracefully and concisely....”) and is known as a SYSTEM \nPROMPT. A PROMPT INJECTION overrides these instructions, exploiting the concatena-\ntion of untrusted user output to the system prompt to induce unintended behavior . \nFor example, an attacker could inject a JAILBREAK that overrides the system prompt to \ncause the model to generate restricted or unsafe outputs. Since these prompts have \nbeen carefully crafted through prompt engineering and may be security-relevant, a \nPROMPT EXTRACTION attack may attempt to steal these system instructions. These \nattacks are also relevant to multimodal and text-to-image models. \n'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | A jailbreak is a direct prompting attack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as bypassing refusal behavior to enable misuse.                                                                                                                                                                                               |       0.875    |           0.982077 |            1        |       nan        | semantic_splitter   |

These challenges span different phases of ML operations such \nas the potential for adversarial manipulation of training data; the provision of adversar-\nial inputs to adversely affect the performance of the AI system; and even malicious ma-\nnipulations, modifications, or interactions with models to exfiltrate sensitive information \nfrom the model’s training data or to which the model has access. Such attacks have been \ndemonstrated under real-world conditions, and their sophistication and impacts have been \nincreasing steadily. \nThe field of AML is concerned with studying these attacks. It must consider the capabilities \nof attackers, the model or system properties that attackers might seek to violate in pursuit \nof their objectives, and the design of attack methods that exploit vulnerabilities during the \ndevelopment, training, and deployment phases of the ML life cycle. It is also concerned \nwith the design of ML algorithms and systems that can withstand these security and privacy \nchallenges, a property often known as robustness [274]. \nTo taxonimize these attacks, this report differentiates between predictive and generative \nAI systems and the attacks relevant to each. It considers the components of an AI system \nincluding the data; the model itself; the processes for training, testing, and deploying the \nmodel; and the broader software and system contexts into which models may be embed-\nded, such as cases where Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models are deployed \nwith access to private data or equipped with tools to take actions with real-world conse-\nquences. \nThus, the attacks within this taxonomy are classified relative to: (i) the AI system type, (ii) \nthe stage of the ML life cycle process in which the attack is mounted, (iii) the attacker’s \ngoals and objectives in terms of the system properties they seek to violate, (iv) the at-\ntacker’s capabilities and access, and (v) the attacker’s knowledge of the learning process \nand beyond. \nThis report adopts the concepts of security, resilience, and robustness of ML systems from \nthe NIST AI Risk Management Framework. Security, resilience, and robustness are gauged \nby risk, which is a measure of the extent to which an entity (e.g., a system) is threatened by \na potential circumstance or event (e.g., an attack) and the severity of the outcome should \nsuch an event occur . However, this report does not make recommendations on risk toler-\nance (i.e., the level of risk that is acceptable to organizations or society) because it is highly \ncontextual and specific to applications and use cases. \n']                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

People said he went out at night when the moon was down, \nand peeped in windows. When people’s azaleas froze in a cold snap, it was \nbecause he had breathed on them. Any stealthy small crimes committed in \nMaycomb were his work. Once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid \nnocturnal events: people’s chickens and household pets were found mutilated; \nalthough the culprit was Crazy Addie, who eventually drowned himself in \nBarker’s Eddy, people still looked at the Radley Place, unwilling to discard their \ninitial suspicions. A Negro would not pass the Radley Place at night, he would cut \nacross to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked. The Maycomb school \ngrounds adjoined the back of the Radley lot; from the Radley chickenyard tall \npecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard, but the nuts lay untouched by the \nchildren: Radley pecans would kill you. A baseball hit into the Radley yard was a \nlost ball and no questions asked.\nThe misery of that house began many years before Jem and I were born. The \nRadleys, welcome anywhere in town, kept to themselves, a predilection \nunforgivable in Maycomb. They did not go to church, Maycomb’s principal \nrecreation, but worshiped at home; Mrs. Radley seldom if ever crossed the street \nfor a mid-morning coffee break with her neighbors, and certainly never joined a \nmissionary circle.

When we went home, Jem put the dolls in his trunk.\nLess than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum, which we \nenjoyed, the fact that everything on the Radley Place was poison having slipped \nJem’s memory.\nThe following week the knot-hole yielded a tarnished medal. Jem showed it to \nAtticus, who said it was a spelling medal, that before we were born the Maycomb \nCounty schools had spelling contests and awarded medals to the winners. Atticus \nsaid someone must have lost it, and had we asked around? Jem camel-kicked me \nwhen I tried to say where we had found it. Jem asked Atticus if he remembered \nanybody who ever won one, and Atticus said no.\nOur biggest prize appeared four days later. It was a pocket watch that wouldn’t \nrun, on a chain with an aluminum knife.\n“You reckon it’s white gold, Jem?”\n“Don’t know. I’ll show it to Atticus.”\nAtticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars, knife, chain and all, if it were \nnew. “Did you swap with somebody at school?” he asked.\n“Oh, no sir!” Jem pulled out his grandfather’s watch that Atticus let him carry \nonce a week if Jem were careful with it. On the days he carried the watch, Jem \nwalked on eggs. “Atticus, if it’s all right with you, I’d rather have this one instead. \nMaybe I can fix it.”\nWhen the new wore off his grandfather’s watch, and carrying it became a day’s \nburdensome task, Jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every \nfive minutes.\nHe did a fair job, only one spring and two tiny pieces left over, but the watch \nwould not run. “Oh-h,” he sighed, “it’ll never go. Scout—?”\n“Huh?”\n“You reckon we oughta write a letter to whoever’s leaving us these things?”\n“That’d be right nice, Jem, we can thank ‘em—what’s wrong?”\nJem was holding his ears, shaking his head from side to side. “I don’t get it, I just \ndon’t get it—I don’t know why, Scout…” He looked toward the livingroom.

You plug ‘em with cement when they’re sick. You ought to know \nthat, Jem.”\nJem said nothing more about it until late afternoon. When we passed our tree he \ngave it a meditative pat on its cement, and remained deep in thought. He seemed \nto be working himself into a bad humor, so I kept my distance.\nAs usual, we met Atticus coming home from work that evening. When we were at \nour steps Jem said, “Atticus, look down yonder at that tree, please sir.”\n“What tree, son?”\n“The one on the corner of the Radley lot comin‘ from school.”\n“Yes?”\n“Is that tree dyin‘?”\n“Why no, son, I don’t think so. Look at the leaves, they’re all green and full, no \nbrown patches anywhere—”\n“It ain’t even sick?”\n“That tree’s as healthy as you are, Jem.

He was beginning to preface some things he said with a \nthroaty noise, and I thought he must at last be getting old, but he looked the same. \n”I don’t exactly know how to say this,“ he began.\n“Well, just say it,” said Jem. “Have we done something?”\nOur father was actually fidgeting. “No, I just want to explain to you that—your \nAunt Alexandra asked me… son, you know you’re a Finch, don’t you?”\n“That’s what I’ve been told.” Jem looked out of the corners of his eyes. His voice \nrose uncontrollably, “Atticus, what’s the matter?”\nAtticus crossed his knees and folded his arms. “I’m trying to tell you the facts of \nlife.”\nJem’s disgust deepened. “I know all that stuff,” he said.\nAtticus suddenly grew serious. In his lawyer’s voice, without a shade of \ninflection, he said: “Your aunt has asked me to try and impress upon you and Jean \nLouise that you are not from run-of-the-mill people, that you are the product of \nseveral generations’ gentle breeding—” Atticus paused, watching me locate an \nelusive redbug on my leg.\n“Gentle breeding,” he continued, when I had found and scratched it, “and that you \nshould try to live up to your name—” Atticus persevered in spite of us: “She \nasked me to tell you you must try to behave like the little lady and gentleman that \nyou are.

Well, it’s very simple,” he said. \n']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| Who saved Jem and Scout from Bob Ewell's attack at the end of the book?                                                                                                                 | From the provided excerpts, it appears that Atticus Finch is the one who saves Jem and Scout from potential harm by Bob Ewell. However, it's important to note that the context does not explicitly state that Bob Ewell attacked them at the end of the book, but rather that they were scared for Atticus due to threats from Bob Ewell. The resolution of the threat is implied through Atticus's actions in comforting and protecting Jem and Scout, as seen in the first excerpt where he discovers their fear and reassures them. In the second excerpt, it seems that Cecil Jacobs has wrongfully accused Atticus of defending "niggers," but there is no mention of a direct attack at the end of the book. Therefore, the exact nature of the threat and its resolution might require more context or information beyond what is provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ['all, we would starve if Mr. Ewell killed him, besides be raised exclusively by \nAunt Alexandra, and we all knew the first thing she’d do before Atticus was \nunder the ground good would be to fire Calpurnia. Jem said it might work if I \ncried and flung a fit, being young and a girl. That didn’t work either. But when he \nnoticed us dragging around the neighborhood, not eating, taking little interest in \nour normal pursuits, Atticus discovered how deeply frightened we were. He \ntempted Jem with a new football magazine one night; when he saw Jem flip the \npages and toss it aside, he said, “What’s bothering you, son?”\nJem came to the point: “Mr. Ewell.”\n“What has happened?”\n“Nothing’s happened. We’re scared for you, and we think you oughta do \nsomething about him.”\nAtticus smiled wryly. “Do what?

I denied it, but told Jem.\n“What’d he mean sayin‘ that?” I asked.\n“Nothing,” Jem said. “Ask Atticus, he’ll tell you.”\n“Do you defend niggers, Atticus?” I asked him that evening.\n“Of course I do.

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | In the provided context, a white-box attack refers to an adversarial scenario where the attacker has comprehensive knowledge about the Machine Learning (ML) system. This includes knowing the model architecture, its parameters, and often the training data. On the other hand, a black-box attack assumes that the attacker operates with minimal or no knowledge about the ML system. The attacker may only have query access to the model but lacks any other information regarding how it was trained. This is further highlighted by noting that these attacks are practical since they assume the attacker has no knowledge of the AI system and utilizes readily available system interfaces for normal use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nto evaluate potential mitigations. This definition is more general and encompasses the no-\ntion of adaptive attacks in which knowledge of the mitigations applied to the model or the \nsystem is explicitly tracked. \nBlack-box attacks. These attacks assume that the attacker operates with minimal, and \nsometimes no knowledge at all about the ML system. An adversary might have query \naccess to the model, but they have no other information about how the model is trained. \nThese attacks are the most practical since they assume that the attacker has no knowledge \nof the AI system and utilizes system interfaces readily available for normal use. \nGray-box attacks. There are a range of gray-box attacks that capture adversarial knowl-\nedge between black-box and white-box attacks. Suciu et al. [358] introduced a framework \nto classify gray-box attacks. An attacker might know the model architecture but not its pa-\nrameters, or the attacker might know the model and its parameters but not the training \ndata. Other common assumptions for gray-box attacks are that the attacker has access to \ndata distributed identically to the training data and knows the feature representation. The \nlatter assumption is important for applications in which feature extraction is used before \ntraining an ML model, such as cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. \n'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | A white-box attack assumes the attacker has full knowledge of the machine learning system, including training data and architecture.

| Summarize the plot of the 'Boo Radley' game that Jem, Scout, and Dill play.                                                                                                             | In the given text, it is mentioned that Jem, Scout, and Dill play a make-believe game based on neighborhood legends about Boo Radley. Each character assumes different roles; Scout is asked to portray Mrs. Radley. The game involves some elements of fear and mystery surrounding Boo Radley, as they act out scenarios using household items and improvise dialogues. It's also mentioned that Jem sneaks into the house (presumably the Radleys') and pretends to harm Dill while Scout watches from a distance. The game stops when any neighbors are around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ['I reluctantly played assorted \nladies who entered the script. I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I \nplayed that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jem’s assurances that \nBoo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in \nthe daytime and Atticus home at night.\nJem was a born hero.\nIt was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and \nneighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr. \nRadley and lost all her money. She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her \nright forefinger (Dill’s contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldn’t find \nany cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the \ntime, while Boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house.\nThe three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for a \nchange; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with \nthe brushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff, \nassorted townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the \nRadleys than anybody in Maycomb.\nWhen it was time to play Boo’s big scene, Jem would sneak into the house, steal \nthe scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when Calpurnia’s back was turned, \nthen sit in the swing and cut up newspapers. Dill would walk by, cough at Jem, \nand Jem would fake a plunge into Dill’s thigh. From where I stood it looked real.\nWhen Mr. Nathan Radley passed us on his daily trip to town, we would stand still \nand silent until he was out of sight, then wonder what he would do to us if he \nsuspected.

There was an ugly mark along one side of his \nface. His left arm lay out from his body; his elbow was bent slightly, but in the \nwrong direction. Jem was frowning.\n“Jem…?”\nAtticus spoke. “He can’t hear you, Scout, he’s out like a light. He was coming \naround, but Dr. Reynolds put him out again.”\n“Yes sir.” I retreated. Jem’s room was large and square. Aunt Alexandra was \nsitting in a rocking-chair by the fireplace. The man who brought Jem in was \nstanding in a corner, leaning against the wall. He was some countryman I did not \nknow. He had probably been at the pageant, and was in the vicinity when it \nhappened.

| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | Based on the provided context, Aunt Alexandra does not explicitly define 'fine folks.' However, her statement indicates that she considers some people to be good but not 'our kind of folks.' This seems to suggest a distinction between social groups or classes. In contrast, it's not clear if Scout has a specific understanding of 'fine folks,' but she appears to question this distinction made by Aunt Alexandra when she says, "Well I do too—," referring to her appreciation for things like fiddling, which Aunt Alexandra seems to associate with a different social group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ['When she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, Aunt Alexandra \nseemed as if she had always lived with us.

| What are the three main attacker objectives in the taxonomy of attacks on predictive AI (PredAI) systems as defined in the NIST document?                                               | The provided context indicates that the taxonomy of attacks on PredAI systems in the NIST document defines three broad categories of attacker goals and objectives. However, the question asks for the main objectives rather than the categories themselves. Based on the information provided, we can infer that these three main objectives are related to Query Access (privacy and model control), Model (data extraction, reconstruction, membership inference, and property inference), and Availability/Energy/Latency (model poisoning).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \n2.

This maturity level suggests that there may be room for improvement in terms of standardization, documentation, and measurement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ['the questions above.

However, based on the conversation between the characters, it appears that this quote may have been shared by one of the adults, possibly Atticus Finch or another character, though not explicitly stated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ['maybe… son, I told you that if you hadn’t lost your head I’d have made you go \nread to her.

They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.

The core metrics are assessed annually by the IGs and represent a \ncombination of Administration priorities, high impact security processes, and essential functions \nnecessary to determine security program effectiveness.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | There are 20 core metrics that are assessed annually by the Inspectors General (IGs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     nan        |           0.91954  |            1        |       nan        | recursive_character |

| In the context of Generative AI, what is a 'jailbreak'?                                                                                                                                 | In the given context, a 'jailbreak' appears to refer to a method or technique used to bypass or subvert a generative model, potentially by exploiting its vulnerabilities. The process may involve using a high-quality classifier to train a new generative model specifically designed to produce output that the original model classifies as harmful or undesirable. The information suggests that this can be done with minimal human intervention and without direct access to the internal workings of either model, just through query access. This concept is discussed in relation to an open robustness benchmark for jailbreaking large language models, as presented in the paper "JailbreakBench: An Open Robustness Benchmark for Jailbreaking Large Language Models" by Pappas et al., 2024.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ['and a judge [73, 239, 292]. When the attacker has access to a high-quality classifier \nthat judges whether model output is harmful, it may be used as a reward function to \ntrain a generative model to generate jailbreaks of another generative model. Only \nquery access is required for each of the models, and no human intervention is re-\nquired to update or refine a candidate jailbreak. The prompts may also be transfer-\nable from the target model to other closed-source LLMs [73].'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | A jailbreak is a direct prompting attack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as bypassing refusal behavior to enable misuse.                                                                                                                                                                                               |       0.9      |           0.958736 |            1        |       nan        | recursive_character |

| Describe the 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level for the metric regarding an organization's inventory of information systems.                                                     | The term 'Consistently Implemented' in this context refers to a stage where the process or practice is consistently executed across all relevant areas without significant deviation. For the metric you mentioned about maintaining an inventory of information systems, it suggests that at this level, the organization has implemented the process of creating and maintaining an inventory of its information systems on a regular basis and with minimal inconsistencies.

| Summarize the plot of the 'Boo Radley' game that Jem, Scout, and Dill play.                                                                                                             | In the provided text, it appears that Jem, Scout, and Dill are playing a game involving Boo Radley, a reclusive character from their neighborhood. The children plan to give a note to Boo Radley, but they require one of them (presumably Scout) to come out and play if she's not scared, as per the roles assigned by Jem. Dill warns that if Scout doesn't agree to do what they tell her, they won't share any details about their plan.

| Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23.                                                      | In Chapter 23, both Jem and Scout express their thoughts about why people seem to despise each other despite being similar or alike. However, they differ in their conclusions. While Jem initially questions the existence of different kinds of folks due to the observed animosity, Atticus clarifies that everyone learns and progresses at their own pace, suggesting there is essentially only one kind of folks. On the other hand, Scout posits a possible reason for the differences among people by mentioning the Cunninghams, who she believes might struggle with reading and writing compared to them due to their circumstances. This hints at Scout's understanding that societal conditions can impact an individual's ability to learn and progress. Atticus counters this by emphasizing that everyone requires learning, and there is nothing inherently wrong with those who may be held back by external factors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ['folks.

His brows came \ntogether; his mouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while.\n“That’s what I thought, too,” he said at last, “when I was your age.

| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | In the provided context, Aunt Alexandra doesn't explicitly define what she means by "our kind of folks." However, she uses a phrase that suggests they might not be well-mannered or refined, which is different from Scout's interpretation. Scout initially interprets "our kind of folks" as being good people, but Aunt Alexandra clarifies later in the conversation that it means they are not part of their social circle, possibly due to differences in manners or interests. Jem explains that Aunt Alexandra considers them 'yappy,' which he translates as tacky, and that they enjoy activities like fiddling.

| What are the three main attacker objectives in the taxonomy of attacks on predictive AI (PredAI) systems as defined in the NIST document?                                               | The text does not specify the exact three main attacker objectives in the taxonomy of attacks on Predictive AI (PredAI) systems. However, it is indicated that the taxonomy defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and goals. The objectives can be inferred by understanding the nature of the provided context information which hints at categorizing attacks based on attacker capabilities and corresponding objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ['This report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems.

| What are the six cybersecurity functions that Inspectors General use to determine an agency's effectiveness?                                                                            | Based on the provided context, it appears that the document discusses two aspects of cybersecurity: governance and roles, responsibilities, and authorities. However, the text does not explicitly list six specific cybersecurity functions used by Inspectors General to determine an agency's effectiveness. The first function discussed is the development and maintenance of cybersecurity profiles to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize, and communicate cybersecurity objectives (as per page 8). The second function, though not labeled as such in the text, seems to relate to the assessment of how cybersecurity roles, responsibilities, and authorities foster accountability, performance assessment, and continuous improvement (as per page 17). While there are no six specific functions listed, these two functions can be considered as part of the broader process used by Inspectors General to evaluate an agency's cybersecurity effectiveness.                                                                                                                                                                                             | ['17 \n \nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL \n3.

| What are the two broad classes of AI systems distinguished in the NIST AI 100-2e2025 report?                                                                                            | The provided context does not explicitly mention any two broad classes of AI systems distinguished in the NIST AI 100-2e2025 report. However, it is mentioned that the report discusses Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). This suggests that one possible distinction could be between standard machine learning approaches and adversarial machine learning. Yet, without further context or details from the report itself, this is only a speculation based on the information given.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nExecutive Summary \nThis NIST Trustworthy and Responsible AI report describes a taxonomy and terminology \nfor ADVERSARIAL MACHINE LEARNING (AML) that may aid in securing applications of artificial \nintelligence (AI) against adversarial manipulations and attacks.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The report distinguishes between two broad classes of AI systems: predictive AI (PredAI) and generative AI (GenAI).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     nan        |           0.5      |            0        |         1        | hierarchical        |

| What Language Model (LLM) is specified as a control for the chunking strategy experiment?                                                                                               | The Language Model (LLM) mentioned in the context for the chunking strategy experiment is not explicitly stated. However, there are references to other LLMs such as those by Chawla, Wiest, and Zhang (2024), Dettmers et al. (2023). It would be best to investigate these or similar models in further study for the purpose of a chunking strategy experiment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ['Chawla, \nOlaf Wiest, and Xiangliang Zhang.

However, it seems that they manage to escape on their own, as indicated by Scout's statement about finding out the details the next day.

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | In a white-box attack, the adversary has complete knowledge of the model architecture and parameters, as discussed in Section 2.1.4. On the other hand, a black-box attack is designed under a realistic adversarial model where the attacker lacks prior knowledge about the model's underlying architecture or training data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \n2.2.2.

This game seems to involve approaching his house, which has a loose shutter on its window, during the night while the Radleys are asleep. However, Scout expresses her fear about this endeavor, as she believes that Boo can leave the house at night.

The plot includes scenes where Boo (played by Jem) is locked up by his father, stabs his father's leg with scissors, and is eventually stuffed up a chimney. The children play various roles, including the Radley family members, the probate judge, and Miss Stephanie Crawford. |       0.777778 |           0.889631 |            1        |         0        | hierarchical        |

| Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23.                                                      | In the given context, it appears that both Jem and Scout are trying to understand the concept of what makes 'folks' different from one another, as presented by Atticus in chapter 23. While Atticus expresses a positive view towards certain individuals who may not belong to their immediate social circle (referred to as "they" and "them"), Jem interprets this distinction as a matter of taste or cultural differences. He describes these people as 'yappy' and associates them with activities like fiddling, which he finds tacky or unrefined. On the other hand, Scout seems open to liking such activities herself, suggesting that she may not share Jem's prejudice towards these individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ['“Gentlemen,” he said.

| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | In the provided context, Aunt Alexandra seems to associate 'Fine Folks' with families who have a long history of residing on the same land. On the other hand, Scout doesn't explicitly provide an understanding of what 'Fine Folks' are in the given excerpts, but it appears that she may not fully agree with Aunt Alexandra's definition since she expresses a liking for activities (such as fiddling) that Aunt Alexandra might consider 'yappy' or tacky. However, further context is needed to confirm whether this contrast in understanding is consistent throughout the text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ['I never understood her preoccupation with heredity.
