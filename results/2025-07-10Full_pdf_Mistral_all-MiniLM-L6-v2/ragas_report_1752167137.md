A child had as many fathers as there were men in the \ncommunity, as many mothers as there were women. J. Grimes Everett was doing \nhis utmost to change this state of affairs, and desperately needed our prayers.\nMaycomb was itself again. Precisely the same as last year and the year before \nthat, with only two minor changes. Firstly, people had removed from their store \nwindows and automobiles the stickers that said NRA—WE DO OUR PART. I \nasked Atticus why, and he said it was because the National Recovery Act was \ndead. I asked who killed it: he said nine old men.\nThe second change in Maycomb since last year was not one of national \nsignificance.

In GenAI moreso than in PredAI, different activities such as data col-\nlection, model training, model deployment, and application development are often carried \nout by multiple different organizations or actors. \nFor example, a common paradigm in GenAI is the use of a smaller number of foundation \nmodels to support a diverse range of downstream applications. Foundation models are \npre-trained on large-scale data using self-supervised learning in order to encode general \npatterns in text, images, or other data that may be relevant for many different applica-\ntions [311]. Data at the scale used in foundation models is often collected from a variety \nof internet sources (which attackers can target, such as in DATA POISONING attacks). \nThis generalist learning paradigm equips foundation models with a variety of capabilities \nand tendencies — many of which are desirable, but some of which may be harmful or \nunwanted by the model developer . Techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and \nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can be used after initial pre-training \nto better align the base model with human preferences and to curb undesirable or harmful \nmodel outputs [281] (see Fig. 3).']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

It indicates that an agency or organization does not have established policies and procedures for their information security programs, and they do not consistently implement them either. This level (level 1) serves as a starting point for agencies to develop sound policies and procedures, setting a foundation for improvement towards higher levels of maturity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ['T\nhe guide is a companion document to the FY 2025 IG FISMA metrics1 and OMB M-25-042 \nwhich provides guidance to IGs to assist in their FISMA evaluations. \n \nD\netermining Effectiveness with IG Metrics  \nIGs are required to assess the effectiveness of information security programs on a maturity model \nspectrum, in which the foundational levels ensure that agencies develop sound policies and \nprocedures, and at the advanced levels capture the extent that agencies institutionalize those \npolicies and procedures.  The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

As a general best practice, broad recommendations should be \navoided.  Recommendations should be focused on specific actions to address the root cause and \nlead the agency to that next maturity level.  It may require several recommendations to get that \nmetric to the next level, however this provides the agency with specific guidance and the \nopportunity to make steady and visible progress.  This approach would also allow the assessors \nto follow-up on agency actions taken as part of their recommendation follow-up processes and/or \nthe next FISMA evaluation.  It is a matter of opinion, however generally a higher quantity of \nspecific recommendations is preferable over fewer broad recommendations.  \n \nH\now should agencies consider plans of action and milestone (POA&M)? \nAs part of the data collection process, it is recommended that assessors collect and consider open \nPOA&Ms that the organization has self-identified (or other means, such as past GAO or OIG \nreports, or assessment and authorization reviews) as issues they are working to resolve.

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

As a general best practice, broad recommendations should be \navoided.  Recommendations should be focused on specific actions to address the root cause and \nlead the agency to that next maturity level.  It may require several recommendations to get that \nmetric to the next level, however this provides the agency with specific guidance and the \nopportunity to make steady and visible progress.  This approach would also allow the assessors \nto follow-up on agency actions taken as part of their recommendation follow-up processes and/or \nthe next FISMA evaluation.  It is a matter of opinion, however generally a higher quantity of \nspecific recommendations is preferable over fewer broad recommendations.  \n \nH\now should agencies consider plans of action and milestone (POA&M)? \nAs part of the data collection process, it is recommended that assessors collect and consider open \nPOA&Ms that the organization has self-identified (or other means, such as past GAO or OIG \nreports, or assessment and authorization reviews) as issues they are working to resolve.  As a \nbest practice, assessors should avoid issuing recommendations that the organization is aware of \nand actively working to resolve.  To re-emphasize the open POA&M assessors should consider \nreferencing them in the narrative write up.  Another potential approach would be to issue an \n“Opportunity for Improvement” (OFI) or an “Item for Management’s Consideration” (IMC) to \nstate that the organization should prioritize the POA&M in order to continue to mature the \nmetric, domain, or program.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

However, it suggests that adversarial examples are modifications made to input data with malicious intent, aimed at tricking deep neural networks. These modifications can be created in black-box settings using methods such as zeroth-order optimization, discrete optimization, Bayesian optimization, and transferability. The term is used in the context of machine learning (ML) models, particularly within application domains like cybersecurity, image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, and video classification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ['Even in the more chal-\nlenging black-box setting in which attackers obtain the model’s predicted labels or confi-\ndence scores, deep neural networks are still vulnerable to adversarial examples. Meth-\nods for creating adversarial examples in black-box settings include zeroth-order optimiza-\ntion [80], discrete optimization [254], Bayesian optimization [344], and transferability, which \ninvolves the white-box generation of adversarial examples on a different model before \ntransferring them to the target model [282, 283, 377]. While cybersecurity and image clas-\nsifications were the first application domains to showcase evasion attacks, ML technology \nin many other application domains has come under scrutiny, including speech recogni-\ntion [66], natural language processing [185], and video classification [215, 401]. \nMitigating adversarial examples is a well-known challenge in the community and deserves \nadditional research and investigation.

Mitigations \nMitig\nating evasion attacks is challenging because adversarial examples are widespread in \na variety of ML model architectures and application domains. Possible explanations for \nthe existence of adversarial examples are that ML models rely on non-robust features that \nare not aligned with human perception in the computer vision domain [174]. In the last \nfew years, many of the proposed mitigations against adversarial examples have been in-\neffective against stronger attacks. Furthermore, several papers have performed extensive \nevaluations and defeated a large number of proposed mitigations: \n• Carlini and Wagner showed how to bypass 10 methods for detecting adversarial ex-\namples and described several guidelines for evaluating defenses [64]. Recent work \nshows that detecting adversarial examples is as difficult as building a defense [373]. \nTherefore, this direction for mitigating adversarial examples is similarly challenging \nas designing defenses. \n• The Obfuscated Gradients attack [20] was specifically designed to defeat several pro-\nposed defenses that rely on masking gradients to protect against optimization-based \nattacks. It relies on a new technique, Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation, \nwhich approximates the gradient during the backward pass of backpropagation, and \nwas shown to bypass several proposed defenses based on gradient masking. \n• Tramèr et al. [375] described a methodology for designing adaptive attacks against \nproposed defenses and circumvented 13 existing defenses. They advocate for de-\nsigning adaptive attacks to test newly proposed defenses rather than merely testing \nthe defenses against well-known attacks. \nFrom the wide range of proposed defenses against adversarial evasion attacks, three main \nclasses have proven to be resilient and have the potential to provide mitigation against \nevasion attacks: \n1.

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age. If your father was thirty you’d find life quite \ndifferent.”\n“I sure would. Atticus can’t do anything…”\n“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”\n“What can he do?”\n“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”\n“Shoot…”\n“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town?

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

Additional sources such as penetration testing and red team \nassessment results may be effective sources of evidence for select metrics.  \n \nTh\ne “Assessor’s Best Practices” section has replaced the “Additional Notes” section this year.  \nThis section now breaks out the four maturity levels beyond Ad-Hoc to provide the assessor \nspecific evaluation steps to consider for consistent assessment and testing.

Further, IGs should explain in CyberScope the impact this has on the IGs \nability to determine the effectiveness of their agency’s information security program.  \n \nTh\ne tables below show the IG metrics for FY25 IG evaluation period.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The OIG should consider closing the recommendation with a status of 'Unresolved - Closed' and, if appropriate, issue an updated and refocused recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                            |       0.8      |           0.914234 |                 1   |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

OFIs and IMCs could \nbecome recommendations over time (generally 1-2 years) if the POA&Ms or OFIs and IMCs are \nnot timely resolved.   \n \nH\now should OIGs and agencies agree and keep recommendation remediation plans up-to-\ndate? \nOrdinarily, OIGs and Agency officials review and collaborate on recommendations to come to a \nmanagement decision.  This is either done through the agency’s official comments to the report \nor during recommendation follow-up.  During the management decision process it is critical that \nall parties are clear and agree upon the agency’s planned corrective action.  This is the time to \nensure that the planned corrective action meets the intent of the recommendation and the selected \nNIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 controls (or other applicable criteria).  A healthy back and \nforth conversation to come to an agreed upon planned corrective action will ensure that the \nimplemented corrective action also align.

IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022. The goal of this new framework was to provide a more flexible \nbut continued focus on annual assessments for the federal community.

Only \nquery access is required for each of the models, and no human intervention is re-\nquired to update or refine a candidate jailbreak. The prompts may also be transfer-\nable from the target model to other closed-source LLMs [73]. \nThe Crescendo attack [316] introduced the idea of interacting with the model itera-\ntively in a multi-turn adaptive attack that includes seemingly benign prompts, even-\ntually leading to a successful jailbreak against safety alignment. The initial manual \nattack is fully automated by leveraging another LLM for prompt generation and in-\ncorporating multiple input sources. \n45'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | A jailbreak is a direct prompting attack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as bypassing refusal behavior to enable misuse.                                                                                                                                                                                               |     nan        |           0.974827 |                 1   |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

| What are the three primary classes of defenses against adversarial evasion attacks, according to the NIST AI report?                                                                    | The text does not explicitly list three primary classes of defenses against adversarial evasion attacks in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that techniques for generating adversarial examples require white-box access to the model and have been improved by subsequent methods that generated adversarial examples with even smaller perturbations. This suggests that one possible defense strategy could be to focus on improving the robustness of the models against such small perturbations. Additionally, it is stated that adversarial examples are applicable in more realistic black-box settings, implying that defenses in this setting might also be a focus area. Without more specific information from the context, it is not possible to definitively identify three primary classes of defenses against adversarial evasion attacks according to the NIST AI report.                                                                                                                                                                                          | ['NIST Trustworthy and Responsible AI\nNIST AI 100-2e2025\nAdversarial Machine Learning\nA Taxonomy and Terminology of Attacks and Mitigations\nApostol  Vassilev Alina Oprea\nComputer  Security  Division Northeastern University\nInformation Technology Laboratory \nMaia Hamin Alie Fordyce\nU.S. AI Safety Institute Hyrum Anderson\nNational Institute of Standards and Cisco\nTechnology\nXander Davies\nU.K. AI Security Institute\nThis\n publication is available free of charge from:\nhttps://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.100-2e2025\nMarch 2025\nU.S. Department of Commerce\nHoward Lutnick, Secretary\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology\nCraig Burkhardt, Acting Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and Acting NIST Director'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The three main classes of defenses against evasion attacks are adversarial training, randomized smoothing, and formal verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       0.7      |           0        |                 1   |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

Evasion Attacks and Mitigations \n[NISTAML.022] [Back to Index] \nThe discovery of evasion attacks against ML models has led to significant growth in AML \nresearch over the last decade. In an evasion attack, the adversary’s goal is to generate \nadversarial examples: samples whose classification can be changed to an arbitrary class \nof the attacker’s choice – often with only minimal perturbation [362]. For example, in the \ncontext of image classification, the perturbation of the original sample might be small so \nthat a human cannot observe the transformation of the input; while the ML model can \nbe tricked to classify the adversarial example in the target class selected by the attacker, \nhumans still recognize it as part of the original class. \nEarly known instances of evasion attacks date back to 1988 with the work of Kearns and \nLi [192] and 2004 when Dalvi et al. [98] and Lowd and Meek [226] demonstrated the ex-\nistence of adversarial examples for linear classifiers used in spam filters. Later, Szedegy \net al. [362] showed that deep neural networks used for image classification could be eas-\nily manipulated through adversarial examples. In 2013, Szedegy et al. [362] and Biggio \net al. [38] independently discovered an effective method for generating adversarial exam-\nples against linear models and neural networks by applying gradient optimization to an \nadversarial objective function. Both of these techniques require white-box access to the \nmodel and were improved by subsequent methods that generated adversarial examples \nwith even smaller perturbations [20, 65, 232]. \nAdversarial examples are also applicable in more realistic black-box settings in which at-\ntackers only obtain query access capabilities to the trained model. Even in the more chal-\nlenging black-box setting in which attackers obtain the model’s predicted labels or confi-\ndence scores, deep neural networks are still vulnerable to adversarial examples.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Mr. Nathan would \nspeak to us, however, when we said good morning, and sometimes we saw him \ncoming from town with a magazine in his hand.\nThe more we told Dill about the Radleys, the more he wanted to know, the longer \nhe would stand hugging the light-pole on the corner, the more he would wonder.\n“Wonder what he does in there,” he would murmur. “Looks like he’d just stick \nhis head out the door.”'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Arthur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     nan        |           0        |                 0.5 |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

He said Atticus never talked \nmuch about the Radleys: when Jem would question him Atticus’s only answer \nwas for him to mind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a \nright to; but when it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said, “Mm, \nmm, mm.”\nSo Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford, a \nneighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing. According to Miss \nStephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from The \nMaycomb Tribune to paste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr. \nRadley passed by, Boo drove the scissors into his parent’s leg, pulled them out, \nwiped them on his pants, and resumed his activities.\nMrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but \nwhen the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the \nTribune. He was thirty-three years old then.\nMiss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum, \nwhen it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo \nwasn’t crazy, he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr. \nRadley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not \na criminal. The sheriff hadn’t the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so \nBoo was locked in the courthouse basement.\nBoo’s transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jem’s memory. \nMiss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he \ndidn’t take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could \nnot live forever on the bounty of the county.\nNobody knew what form of intimidation Mr.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age. If your father was thirty you’d find life quite \ndifferent.”\n“I sure would. Atticus can’t do anything…”\n“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”\n“What can he do?”\n“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”\n“Shoot…”\n“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town?

He had been lying on the grass. “You \nlittle folks won’t tell on me now, will you? It’d ruin my reputation if you did.”\n“You mean all you drink in that sack’s Coca-Cola? Just plain Coca-Cola?”\n“Yes ma’am,” Mr. Raymond nodded. I liked his smell: it was of leather, horses, \ncottonseed. He wore the only English riding boots I had ever seen. “That’s all I \ndrink, most of the time.”\n“Then you just pretend you’re half—? I beg your pardon, sir,” I caught myself. “I \ndidn’t mean to be—”\nMr. Raymond chuckled, not at all offended, and I tried to frame a discreet \nquestion: “Why do you do like you do?”\n“Wh—oh yes, you mean why do I pretend? Well, it’s very simple,” he said. \n“Some folks don’t—like the way I live. Now I could say the hell with ‘em, I don’t \ncare if they don’t like it. I do say I don’t care if they don’t like it, right enough—\nbut I don’t say the hell with ’em, see?”\nDill and I said, “No sir.”\n“I try to give ‘em a reason, you see. It helps folks if they can latch onto a reason. \nWhen I come to town, which is seldom, if I weave a little and drink out of this \nsack, folks can say Dolphus Raymond’s in the clutches of whiskey—that’s why \nhe won’t change his ways. He can’t help himself, that’s why he lives the way he \ndoes.”\n“That ain’t honest, Mr.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | He drinks Coca-Cola.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     nan        |           0.984842 |                 1   |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

He said he drank some one time and didn’t like it.”\nMiss Maudie laughed. “Wasn’t talking about your father,” she said. “What I \nmeant was, if Atticus Finch drank until he was drunk he wouldn’t be as hard as \nsome men are at their best.

However, it can be inferred that Atticus Finch took steps to protect them from Bob Ewell's potential threats, as he acknowledged their fear for his safety and reassured them that they had nothing to fear from him. He also suggested that Bob Ewell had already taken out his anger on Atticus during the trial. It's not clear whether this is directly related to an attack at the end of the book or if it refers to a different event, as the context does not provide sufficient information about the book's conclusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ['Tate. “Jem never stabbed Bob Ewell.”\nAtticus was silent for a moment.

He \ntempted Jem with a new football magazine one night; when he saw Jem flip the \npages and toss it aside, he said, “What’s bothering you, son?”\nJem came to the point: “Mr. Ewell.”\n“What has happened?”\n“Nothing’s happened. We’re scared for you, and we think you oughta do \nsomething about him.”\nAtticus smiled wryly. “Do what? Put him under a peace bond?”\n“When a man says he’s gonna get you, looks like he means it.”\n“He meant it when he said it,” said Atticus. “Jem, see if you can stand in Bob \nEwell’s shoes a minute. I destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he \nhad any to begin with. The man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind \nalways does.

Walk back in your tracks, though,” he cautioned.\n“Are we gonna have a snow baby, Jem?”\n“No, a real snowman. Gotta work hard, now.”\nJem ran to the back yard, produced the garden hoe and began digging quickly \nbehind the woodpile, placing any worms he found to one side. He went in the \nhouse, returned with the laundry hamper, filled it with earth and carried it to the \nfront yard.\nWhen we had five baskets of earth and two baskets of snow, Jem said we were \nready to begin.\n“Don’t you think this is kind of a mess?” I asked.\n“Looks messy now, but it won’t later,” he said.\nJem scooped up an armful of dirt, patted it into a mound on which he added \nanother load, and another until he had constructed a torso.\n“Jem, I ain’t ever heard of a nigger snowman,” I said.\n“He won’t be black long,” he grunted.\nJem procured some peachtree switches from the back yard, plaited them, and bent \nthem into bones to be covered with dirt.\n“He looks like Stephanie Crawford with her hands on her hips,” I said. “Fat in the \nmiddle and little-bitty arms.”\n“I’ll make ‘em bigger.” Jem sloshed water over the mud man and added more \ndirt. He looked thoughtfully at it for a moment, then he molded a big stomach \nbelow the figure’s waistline. Jem glanced at me, his eyes twinkling: “Mr. Avery’s \nsort of shaped like a snowman, ain’t he?”\nJem scooped up some snow and began plastering it on.

| Describe the 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level for the metric regarding an organization's inventory of information systems.                                                     | The 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level refers to a situation where an organization has defined its policies, procedures, and processes for developing and maintaining a comprehensive and accurate inventory of its information systems and system interconnections, and consistently applies them. This means that the organization has set up protocols for registering and tracking its systems and their connections, has established methods for recording system interconnect inventories, and adheres to these procedures on a regular basis as part of its Information Security Program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ['T\nhe guide is a companion document to the FY 2025 IG FISMA metrics1 and OMB M-25-042 \nwhich provides guidance to IGs to assist in their FISMA evaluations. \n \nD\netermining Effectiveness with IG Metrics  \nIGs are required to assess the effectiveness of information security programs on a maturity model \nspectrum, in which the foundational levels ensure that agencies develop sound policies and \nprocedures, and at the advanced levels capture the extent that agencies institutionalize those \npolicies and procedures.  The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | In the context of the provided NIST AI security document, a white-box attack is an adversarial attack scenario where the attacker has comprehensive knowledge about the machine learning system, including details such as the model architecture, parameters, and training data. On the other hand, a black-box attack assumes that the attacker operates with minimal or no knowledge at all about the ML system. The attacker may have query access to the model but lacks any other information regarding how the model is trained. Gray-box attacks fall between these two extremes, capturing varying levels of adversarial knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nto evaluate potential mitigations. This definition is more general and encompasses the no-\ntion of adaptive attacks in which knowledge of the mitigations applied to the model or the \nsystem is explicitly tracked. \nBlack-box attacks. These attacks assume that the attacker operates with minimal, and \nsometimes no knowledge at all about the ML system. An adversary might have query \naccess to the model, but they have no other information about how the model is trained. \nThese attacks are the most practical since they assume that the attacker has no knowledge \nof the AI system and utilizes system interfaces readily available for normal use. \nGray-box attacks. There are a range of gray-box attacks that capture adversarial knowl-\nedge between black-box and white-box attacks. Suciu et al. [358] introduced a framework \nto classify gray-box attacks. An attacker might know the model architecture but not its pa-\nrameters, or the attacker might know the model and its parameters but not the training \ndata. Other common assumptions for gray-box attacks are that the attacker has access to \ndata distributed identically to the training data and knows the feature representation. The \nlatter assumption is important for applications in which feature extraction is used before \ntraining an ML model, such as cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. \n2.1.5. Data Mo dality \nUntil r\necently, most attacks and defenses in adversarial machine learning have operated \nunder a single modality, but a new trend in the field is to use multimodal data. The tax-\nonomy of attacks defined in Fig. 1 is independent of the modality of the data in specific \napplications. \nThe most common data modalities in the AML literature include: \n• Image: Adversarial examples of image data [144, 362] have the advantage of a con-\ntinuous domain, and gradient-based methods can be applied directly for optimiza-\ntion. Backdoor poisoning attacks were first invented for images [148], and many \nprivacy attacks are run on image datasets (e.g., [342]).'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | A white-box attack assumes the attacker has full knowledge of the machine learning system, including training data and architecture.

| Summarize the plot of the 'Boo Radley' game that Jem, Scout, and Dill play.                                                                                                             | In the game, Jem, Scout, and Dill create a small theatrical performance based on neighborhood legends about Boo Radley. The children assign roles to themselves, with Dill playing villainous characters, Jem taking on heroic ones, and Scout occasionally portraying various female characters. They perfect their play throughout the summer, adding dialogue and plot. The game culminates in a scene where Jem pretends to be Boo Radley, sneaking into a house (likely the Radley's) to cut up newspapers with scissors he has stolen. Dill reacts as if Jem has harmed him, creating a dramatic moment. Their activities are always stopped when neighbors appear, and they express concern about what Mr. Nathan Radley might do if he suspects their play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ['and sweep the porch. Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up and down the \nsidewalk and coughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally, was Boo: he went \nunder the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time.\nAs the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected it, added \ndialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang \nchanges every day.\nDill was a villain’s villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and \nappear tall if height was part of the devilry required. He was as good as his worst \nperformance; his worst performance was Gothic. I reluctantly played assorted \nladies who entered the script. I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I \nplayed that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jem’s assurances that \nBoo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in \nthe daytime and Atticus home at night.\nJem was a born hero.\nIt was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and \nneighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr. \nRadley and lost all her money.

| Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23.                                                      | The provided text does not directly discuss Jem and Scout's views on what makes people different. However, it implies that there might be a difference between them in terms of their reactions to authority and confrontation. While Jem initially appears reluctant to follow Atticus's instructions, he eventually complies. On the other hand, Scout acts impulsively when someone tries to physically hurt Jem, showing a readiness to defend him. This suggests that Scout might perceive differences between people more in terms of their behavior and actions, especially when her pride or loved ones are involved. Jem, however, seems to be more subdued in his responses. The text also hints at some concern from Uncle Jack about how Scout might react to "ugly things" she will encounter, indicating that she might have a less reserved reaction than Jem. This could imply a difference in their understanding or perception of people based on their actions and interactions. However, the full extent of this difference is not explicitly stated in the provided context. | ['night. Hot embarrassment shot through me: I had leaped triumphantly into a ring \nof people I had never seen before.\nAtticus got up from his chair, but he was moving slowly, like an old man. He put \nthe newspaper down very carefully, adjusting its creases with lingering fingers. \nThey were trembling a little.\n“Go home, Jem,” he said. “Take Scout and Dill home.”\nWe were accustomed to prompt, if not always cheerful acquiescence to Atticus’s \ninstructions, but from the way he stood Jem was not thinking of budging.\n“Go home, I said.”\nJem shook his head. As Atticus’s fists went to his hips, so did Jem’s, and as they \nfaced each other I could see little resemblance between them: Jem’s soft brown \nhair and eyes, his oval face and snug-fitting ears were our mother’s, contrasting \noddly with Atticus’s graying black hair and square-cut features, but they were \nsomehow alike. Mutual defiance made them alike.\n“Son, I said go home.”\nJem shook his head.\n“I’ll send him home,” a burly man said, and grabbed Jem roughly by the collar. \nHe yanked Jem nearly off his feet.\n“Don’t you touch him!” I kicked the man swiftly. Barefooted, I was surprised to \nsee him fall back in real pain. I intended to kick his shin, but aimed too high.\n“That’ll do, Scout.” Atticus put his hand on my shoulder. “Don’t kick folks. No\n—” he said, as I was pleading justification.\n“Ain’t nobody gonna do Jem that way,” I said.\n“All right, Mr. Finch, get ‘em outa here,” someone growled. “You got fifteen \nseconds to get ’em outa here.”\nIn the midst of this strange assembly, Atticus stood trying to make Jem mind him.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Jem believes there are four kinds of folks, separated by class and race (e.g., ordinary like the Finches, Cunninghams, Ewells, and Negroes), and that background is determined by how long a family has been literate.

However, from her conversations, it appears she uses the term to refer to people who are socially acceptable or suitable according to her standards. Contrasting with this, Scout seems to interpret 'fine folks' as good-hearted individuals, as shown when she asks why Walter Cunningham cannot be considered fine folks due to his goodness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ['“Don’t be silly, Jean Louise,” said Aunt Alexandra. “The thing is, you can scrub \nWalter Cunningham till he shines, you can put him in shoes and a new suit, but \nhe’ll never be like Jem. Besides, there’s a drinking streak in that family a mile \nwide. Finch women aren’t interested in that sort of people.”\n“Aun-ty,” said Jem, “she ain’t nine yet.”\n“She may as well learn it now.”\nAunt Alexandra had spoken. I was reminded vividly of the last time she had put \nher foot down. I never knew why. It was when I was absorbed with plans to visit \nCalpurnia’s house—I was curious, interested; I wanted to be her “company,” to \nsee how she lived, who her friends were. I might as well have wanted to see the \nother side of the moon. This time the tactics were different, but Aunt Alexandra’s \naim was the same. Perhaps this was why she had come to live with us—to help us \nchoose our friends. I would hold her off as long as I could: “If they’re good folks, \nthen why can’t I be nice to Walter?”\n“I didn’t say not to be nice to him.

As in PredAI (Sec. 2.4.4), attackers may perform MODEL EXTRACTION at-\ntacks which attempt to learn information about the model architecture and parameters by \nsubmitting specially-crafted queries.

[61] demonstrated that such \ninformation could be extracted from black-box production LLMs, deriving previously un-\nknown hidden dimensions and the embedding projection layer (up to symmetries). \n47']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

A child had as many fathers as there were men in the \ncommunity, as many mothers as there were women. J. Grimes Everett was doing \nhis utmost to change this state of affairs, and desperately needed our prayers.\nMaycomb was itself again. Precisely the same as last year and the year before \nthat, with only two minor changes. Firstly, people had removed from their store \nwindows and automobiles the stickers that said NRA—WE DO OUR PART. I \nasked Atticus why, and he said it was because the National Recovery Act was \ndead. I asked who killed it: he said nine old men.\nThe second change in Maycomb since last year was not one of national \nsignificance.

Ma et al. [230] proposed the use of differential privacy \n(DP) as a defense (which follows directly from the definition of differential privacy), but \ndifferentially private ML models may also have lower accuracy than standard models, and \nthe trade-off between robustness and accuracy needs to be considered in each applica-\ntion.

Backdo or Poisoning \n[NIS\nTAML.021, NISTAML.023] [Back to Index] \nBackdoor poisoning attacks are poisoning attacks that cause the targeted model to misclas-\nsify samples containing a particular BACKDOOR PATTERN or trigger . In 2017, Gu et al. [148] \nproposed BadNets, the first backdoor poisoning attack. They observed that image clas-\nsifiers can be poisoned by adding a small patch trigger in a subset of images at training \ntime and changing their label to a target class.

Federated learning allows entities or devices to collabo-\nratively train a global model by exchanging model updates without directly sharing \nthe data that each entity controls. 5, 31 \nfeedforward neural networks Artificial neural networks in which the connections between \nnodes is from one layer to the next and do not form a cycle. 31 \nfine-tuning The process of adapting a pre-trained model to perform specific tasks or spe-\ncialize in a particular domain. This phase follows the initial pre-training phase and \ninvolves further training the model on task-specific data. This is often a supervised \nlearning task. 37 \nfine-tuning circumvention Fine-tuning to remove model refusal behaviour or other model-\nlevel safety interventions. 41 \nformal methods A mathematically rigorous technique for the specification, development, \nand verification of software systems. 18 \nfoundation model In generative AI, models trained on broad data using SELF-SUPERVISED \nLEARNING that can be adapted such as through fine-tuning for a variety of down-\nstream tasks [311]. 111 \nfunctional attack An adversarial attack that is optimized for a set of data in a domain rather \nthan per data point. 13, 23 \nG \ngenerative adversarial networks A machine learning framework in which two neural net-\nworks contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game, where one agent’s \ngain is another agent’s loss. A GAN learns to generate new data with the same \nstatistics as the training set. See [143] for further details. 31, 34 \ngenerative pre-trained transformer (GPT) A family of machine learning models based on \nthe transformer architecture [383] that are pre-trained through SELF-SUPERVISED \nLEARNING on large data sets of unlabelled text.

In GenAI moreso than in PredAI, different activities such as data col-\nlection, model training, model deployment, and application development are often carried \nout by multiple different organizations or actors. \nFor example, a common paradigm in GenAI is the use of a smaller number of foundation \nmodels to support a diverse range of downstream applications. Foundation models are \npre-trained on large-scale data using self-supervised learning in order to encode general \npatterns in text, images, or other data that may be relevant for many different applica-\ntions [311]. Data at the scale used in foundation models is often collected from a variety \nof internet sources (which attackers can target, such as in DATA POISONING attacks). \nThis generalist learning paradigm equips foundation models with a variety of capabilities \nand tendencies — many of which are desirable, but some of which may be harmful or \nunwanted by the model developer . Techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and \nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can be used after initial pre-training \nto better align the base model with human preferences and to curb undesirable or harmful \nmodel outputs [281] (see Fig. 3). However, these interventions can later be targeted using \nAML techniques by attackers seeking to recover or re-enable potentially harmful']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| Describe the Ad Hoc maturity level.                                                                                                                                                     | The provided context does not explicitly define the Ad Hoc maturity level but it is mentioned as the first level in the maturity model spectrum discussed. Generally, in a maturity model, an Ad Hoc level signifies an initial or unstructured state where no established policies, procedures, or practices exist, and there may be inconsistencies or lack of standardization within the process. In this context, Agencies at level 1 (Ad hoc) are developing their information security programs without established policies and procedures in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ['to assist in their FISMA evaluations. \n \nD\netermining Effectiveness with IG Metrics  \nIGs are required to assess the effectiveness of information security programs on a maturity model \nspectrum, in which the foundational levels ensure that agencies develop sound policies and \nprocedures, and at the advanced levels capture the extent that agencies institutionalize those \npolicies and procedures.  The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.

As a general best practice, broad recommendations should be \navoided.  Recommendations should be focused on specific actions to address the root cause and \nlead the agency to that next maturity level.  It may require several recommendations to get that \nmetric to the next level, however this provides the agency with specific guidance and the \nopportunity to make steady and visible progress.  This approach would also allow the assessors \nto follow-up on agency actions taken as part of their recommendation follow-up processes and/or \nthe next FISMA evaluation.  It is a matter of opinion, however generally a higher quantity of \nspecific recommendations is preferable over fewer broad recommendations.  \n \nH\now should agencies consider plans of action and milestone (POA&M)? \nAs part of the data collection process, it is recommended that assessors collect and consider open \nPOA&Ms that the organization has self-identified (or other means, such as past GAO or OIG \nreports, or assessment and authorization reviews) as issues they are working to resolve.  As a \nbest practice, assessors should avoid issuing recommendations that the organization is aware of \nand actively working to resolve.  To re-emphasize the open POA&M assessors should consider \nreferencing them in the narrative write up.  Another potential approach would be to issue an \n“Opportunity for Improvement” (OFI) or an “Item for Management’s Consideration” (IMC) to \nstate that the organization should prioritize the POA&M in order to continue to mature the \nmetric, domain, or program.

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.  For example, “The Agency \n \n1 Final FY 2025 IG FISMA Reporting Metrics (cisa.gov) \n2 Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-25-04 \n3 NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The five maturity levels are Ad Hoc (Level 1), Defined (Level 2), Consistently Implemented (Level 3), Managed and Measurable (Level 4), and Optimized (Level 5).                                                                                                                                                                                         |     nan        |           0.852381 |                 1   |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

As a general best practice, broad recommendations should be \navoided.  Recommendations should be focused on specific actions to address the root cause and \nlead the agency to that next maturity level.  It may require several recommendations to get that \nmetric to the next level, however this provides the agency with specific guidance and the \nopportunity to make steady and visible progress.  This approach would also allow the assessors \nto follow-up on agency actions taken as part of their recommendation follow-up processes and/or \nthe next FISMA evaluation.  It is a matter of opinion, however generally a higher quantity of \nspecific recommendations is preferable over fewer broad recommendations.  \n \nH\now should agencies consider plans of action and milestone (POA&M)? \nAs part of the data collection process, it is recommended that assessors collect and consider open \nPOA&Ms that the organization has self-identified (or other means, such as past GAO or OIG \nreports, or assessment and authorization reviews) as issues they are working to resolve.  As a \nbest practice, assessors should avoid issuing recommendations that the organization is aware of \nand actively working to resolve.  To re-emphasize the open POA&M assessors should consider \nreferencing them in the narrative write up.  Another potential approach would be to issue an \n“Opportunity for Improvement” (OFI) or an “Item for Management’s Consideration” (IMC) to \nstate that the organization should prioritize the POA&M in order to continue to mature the \nmetric, domain, or program.  OFIs and IMCs would be an “unofficial” recommendation that']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

These are demonstrations of evasion vulnerabilities by researchers, \nbut did not result in attacks in the wild. \n2.2.5. Mitigations \nMitig\nating evasion attacks is challenging because adversarial examples are widespread in \na variety of ML model architectures and application domains. Possible explanations for \nthe existence of adversarial examples are that ML models rely on non-robust features that \nare not aligned with human perception in the computer vision domain [174]. In the last \nfew years, many of the proposed mitigations against adversarial examples have been in-\neffective against stronger attacks. Furthermore, several papers have performed extensive \nevaluations and defeated a large number of proposed mitigations: \n• Carlini and Wagner showed how to bypass 10 methods for detecting adversarial ex-\namples and described several guidelines for evaluating defenses [64]. Recent work \nshows that detecting adversarial examples is as difficult as building a defense [373]. \nTherefore, this direction for mitigating adversarial examples is similarly challenging \nas designing defenses. \n• The Obfuscated Gradients attack [20] was specifically designed to defeat several pro-\nposed defenses that rely on masking gradients to protect against optimization-based \nattacks. It relies on a new technique, Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation, \nwhich approximates the gradient during the backward pass of backpropagation, and \nwas shown to bypass several proposed defenses based on gradient masking. \n• Tramèr et al. [375] described a methodology for designing adaptive attacks against \nproposed defenses and circumvented 13 existing defenses. They advocate for de-\nsigning adaptive attacks to test newly proposed defenses rather than merely testing \nthe defenses against well-known attacks. \nFrom the wide range of proposed defenses against adversarial evasion attacks, three main \nclasses have proven to be resilient and have the potential to provide mitigation against \nevasion attacks: \n1. Adversarial training: Introduced by Goodfellow et al. [144] and further developed \nby Madry et al. [232], adversarial training is a general method that augments train-\ning data with adversarial examples generated iteratively during training using their \ncorrect labels.

They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age. If your father was thirty you’d find life quite \ndifferent.”\n“I sure would. Atticus can’t do anything…”\n“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”\n“What can he do?”\n“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”\n“Shoot…”\n“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town?

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.

The guide also includes suggested types of \nanalysis that IGs may perform to assess capabilities in given areas.  The guide should be \nconsidered for suggested source evidence that IGs may request to answer a metric.  The guide \nshould not be considered as an all-inclusive list of source evidence or test methods to reach the \nvarious maturity levels within metrics and domains.

Further, IGs should explain in CyberScope the impact this has on the IGs \nability to determine the effectiveness of their agency’s information security program.  \n \nTh\ne tables below show the IG metrics for FY25 IG evaluation period.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The OIG should consider closing the recommendation with a status of 'Unresolved - Closed' and, if appropriate, issue an updated and refocused recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                            |       1        |           0.666468 |                 1   |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022. The goal of this new framework was to provide a more flexible \nbut continued focus on annual assessments for the federal community.  This effort yielded two \ndistinct groups of metrics: Core and Supplemental. \n \nCo\nre Metrics  \nThere are 20 core metrics.

Introduction \nArtificial intelligence (AI) systems have been on a global expansion trajectory for several \nyears [267]. These systems are being developed by and widely deployed into the economies \nof numerous countries, with increasing opportunities for people to use AI systems in many \nspheres of their lives [92]. This report distinguishes between two broad classes of AI sys-\ntems: predictive AI (PredAI) and generative AI (GenAI). Although the majority of industrial \napplications of AI systems are still dominated by PredAI systems, there has been a recent \nincrease in the adoption of GenAI systems in business and consumer contexts. As these \nsystems permeate the digital economy and become essential parts of daily life, the need \nfor their secure, robust, and resilient operation grows. These operational attributes are \ncritical elements of trustworthy AI in the NIST AI Risk Management Framework [274] and \nthe NCSC Machine Learning Principles [266]. \nThe field of ADVERSARIAL MACHINE LEARNING (AML) studies attacks against ML systems that \nexploit the statistical, data-based nature of ML systems. Despite the significant progress of \nAI and machine learning (ML) in different application domains, these technologies remain \nvulnerable to attacks that can cause spectacular failures. The chances of these kinds of \nfailure increase as ML systems are used in contexts where they may be subject to novel or \nadversarial interactions, and the consequences grow more dire as these systems are used \nin increasingly high-stakes domains. For example, in PredAI computer vision applications \nfor object detection and classification, well-known cases of adversarial perturbations of \ninput images have caused autonomous vehicles to swerve into lanes going in the oppo-\nsite direction, stop signs to be misclassified as speed limit signs, and even people wearing \nglasses to be misidentified in high-security settings [121, 187, 332, 349]. Similarly, the po-\ntential for adversarial input to trick ML models into revealing hidden information has be-\ncome more urgent as more ML models are being deployed in fields like medicine, where \nmedical record leaks can expose sensitive personal information [25, 171]. \nIn GenAI, large language models']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Only \nquery access is required for each of the models, and no human intervention is re-\nquired to update or refine a candidate jailbreak. The prompts may also be transfer-\nable from the target model to other closed-source LLMs [73]. \nThe Crescendo attack [316] introduced the idea of interacting with the model itera-\ntively in a multi-turn adaptive attack that includes seemingly benign prompts, even-\ntually leading to a successful jailbreak against safety alignment. The initial manual \nattack is fully automated by leveraging another LLM for prompt generation and in-\ncorporating multiple input sources. \n45'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | A jailbreak is a direct prompting attack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as bypassing refusal behavior to enable misuse.                                                                                                                                                                                               |       1        |           0.974827 |                 1   |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

However, it does mention that methods for generating adversarial examples have been improved over time, which can be interpreted as a form of defense strategy. The techniques for generating adversarial examples include using gradient optimization and zeroth-order optimization, among others. It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list of all defense strategies against these attacks, but rather some methods that have been developed over the years.

Evasion Attacks and Mitigations \n[NISTAML.022] [Back to Index] \nThe discovery of evasion attacks against ML models has led to significant growth in AML \nresearch over the last decade. In an evasion attack, the adversary’s goal is to generate \nadversarial examples: samples whose classification can be changed to an arbitrary class \nof the attacker’s choice – often with only minimal perturbation [362]. For example, in the \ncontext of image classification, the perturbation of the original sample might be small so \nthat a human cannot observe the transformation of the input; while the ML model can \nbe tricked to classify the adversarial example in the target class selected by the attacker, \nhumans still recognize it as part of the original class. \nEarly known instances of evasion attacks date back to 1988 with the work of Kearns and \nLi [192] and 2004 when Dalvi et al. [98] and Lowd and Meek [226] demonstrated the ex-\nistence of adversarial examples for linear classifiers used in spam filters. Later, Szedegy \net al. [362] showed that deep neural networks used for image classification could be eas-\nily manipulated through adversarial examples. In 2013, Szedegy et al. [362] and Biggio \net al. [38] independently discovered an effective method for generating adversarial exam-\nples against linear models and neural networks by applying gradient optimization to an \nadversarial objective function. Both of these techniques require white-box access to the \nmodel and were improved by subsequent methods that generated adversarial examples \nwith even smaller perturbations [20, 65, 232]. \nAdversarial examples are also applicable in more realistic black-box settings in which at-\ntackers only obtain query access capabilities to the trained model. Even in the more chal-\nlenging black-box setting in which attackers obtain the model’s predicted labels or confi-\ndence scores, deep neural networks are still vulnerable to adversarial examples. Meth-\nods for creating adversarial examples in black-box settings include zeroth-order optimiza-\ntion [80], discrete optimization']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

| What Language Model (LLM) is specified as a control for the chunking strategy experiment?                                                                                               | The given context does not specify a specific language model (LLM) that is being used as a control for the chunking strategy experiment. However, it mentions that the language model (LLM) used in the tests is 'llama3.1:8b'.

He said Atticus never talked \nmuch about the Radleys: when Jem would question him Atticus’s only answer \nwas for him to mind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a \nright to; but when it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said, “Mm, \nmm, mm.”\nSo Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford, a \nneighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing. According to Miss \nStephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from The \nMaycomb Tribune to paste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr. \nRadley passed by, Boo drove the scissors into his parent’s leg, pulled them out, \nwiped them on his pants, and resumed his activities.\nMrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but \nwhen the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the \nTribune. He was thirty-three years old then.\nMiss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum, \nwhen it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo \nwasn’t crazy, he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr. \nRadley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not \na criminal.

He said Atticus never talked \nmuch about the Radleys: when Jem would question him Atticus’s only answer \nwas for him to mind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a \nright to; but when it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said, “Mm, \nmm, mm.”\nSo Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford, a \nneighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing. According to Miss \nStephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from The \nMaycomb Tribune to paste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr. \nRadley passed by, Boo drove the scissors into his parent’s leg, pulled them out, \nwiped them on his pants, and resumed his activities.\nMrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but \nwhen the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the \nTribune. He was thirty-three years old then.\nMiss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum, \nwhen it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo \nwasn’t crazy, he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr. \nRadley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not \na criminal. The sheriff hadn’t the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so \nBoo was locked in the courthouse basement.\nBoo’s transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jem’s memory. \nMiss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he \ndidn’t take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could \nnot live forever on the bounty of the county.\nNobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep Boo out of \nsight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained to the']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age. If your father was thirty you’d find life quite \ndifferent.”\n“I sure would. Atticus can’t do anything…”\n“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”\n“What can he do?”\n“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”\n“Shoot…”\n“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town? Why, down at the \nLanding when we were coming up, Atticus Finch could beat everybody on both \nsides of the river.”'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | The story is narrated by Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     nan        |           0.98623  |                 1   |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

He had been lying on the grass. “You \nlittle folks won’t tell on me now, will you? It’d ruin my reputation if you did.”\n“You mean all you drink in that sack’s Coca-Cola? Just plain Coca-Cola?”\n“Yes ma’am,” Mr. Raymond nodded. I liked his smell: it was of leather, horses, \ncottonseed. He wore the only English riding boots I had ever seen. “That’s all I \ndrink, most of the time.”\n“Then you just pretend you’re half—? I beg your pardon, sir,” I caught myself. “I \ndidn’t mean to be—”\nMr. Raymond chuckled, not at all offended, and I tried to frame a discreet \nquestion: “Why do you do like you do?”\n“Wh—oh yes, you mean why do I pretend? Well, it’s very simple,” he said. \n“Some folks don’t—like the way I live. Now I could say the hell with ‘em, I don’t \ncare if they don’t like it. I do say I don’t care if they don’t like it, right enough—\nbut I don’t say the hell with ’em, see?”\nDill and I said, “No sir.”\n“I try to give ‘em a reason, you see. It helps folks if they can latch onto a reason. \nWhen I come to town, which is seldom, if I weave a little and drink out of this \nsack, folks can say Dolphus Raymond’s in the clutches of whiskey—that’s why \nhe won’t change his ways. He can’t help himself, that’s why he lives the way he \ndoes.”\n“That ain’t honest, Mr. Raymond, making yourself out badder’n you are already\n—”\n“It ain’t honest but it’s mighty helpful to folks.

This is inferred from the context where Atticus talks about taking the threat from Bob Ewell for his children, and Aunt Alexandra expressing doubts about what Ewell could do to him, which Atticus dismisses. Additionally, it is mentioned that Mr. Tate believes Scout was too scared to know exactly what happened during the attack, indicating that someone else may have been present or involved in intervening. The fact that Atticus responds angrily to Mr. Tate's suggestion that Scout might not have known exactly what happened also supports this interpretation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ['all, we would starve if Mr. Ewell killed him, besides be raised exclusively by \nAunt Alexandra, and we all knew the first thing she’d do before Atticus was \nunder the ground good would be to fire Calpurnia. Jem said it might work if I \ncried and flung a fit, being young and a girl. That didn’t work either. But when he \nnoticed us dragging around the neighborhood, not eating, taking little interest in \nour normal pursuits, Atticus discovered how deeply frightened we were. He \ntempted Jem with a new football magazine one night; when he saw Jem flip the \npages and toss it aside, he said, “What’s bothering you, son?”\nJem came to the point: “Mr. Ewell.”\n“What has happened?”\n“Nothing’s happened. We’re scared for you, and we think you oughta do \nsomething about him.”\nAtticus smiled wryly. “Do what? Put him under a peace bond?”\n“When a man says he’s gonna get you, looks like he means it.”\n“He meant it when he said it,” said Atticus. “Jem, see if you can stand in Bob \nEwell’s shoes a minute. I destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he \nhad any to begin with. The man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind \nalways does. So if spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewell \none extra beating, that’s something I’ll gladly take. He had to take it out on \nsomebody and I’d rather it be me than that houseful of children out there. You \nunderstand?”\nJem nodded.\nAunt Alexandra entered the room as Atticus was saying, “We don’t have anything \nto fear from Bob Ewell, he got it all out of his system that morning.”\n“I wouldn’t be so sure of that, Atticus,” she said. “His kind’d do anything to pay \noff a grudge. You know how those people are.”\n“What on earth could Ewell do to me, sister?”\n“Something furtive,” Aunt Alexandra said. “You may count on that.”\n“Nobody has much chance to be furtive'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Arthur 'Boo' Radley.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       0.666667 |           1        |                 0   |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

Walk back in your tracks, though,” he cautioned.\n“Are we gonna have a snow baby, Jem?”\n“No, a real snowman. Gotta work hard, now.”\nJem ran to the back yard, produced the garden hoe and began digging quickly \nbehind the woodpile, placing any worms he found to one side. He went in the \nhouse, returned with the laundry hamper, filled it with earth and carried it to the \nfront yard.\nWhen we had five baskets of earth and two baskets of snow, Jem said we were \nready to begin.\n“Don’t you think this is kind of a mess?” I asked.\n“Looks messy now, but it won’t later,” he said.\nJem scooped up an armful of dirt, patted it into a mound on which he added \nanother load, and another until he had constructed a torso.\n“Jem, I ain’t ever heard of a nigger snowman,” I said.\n“He won’t be black long,” he grunted.\nJem procured some peachtree switches from the back yard, plaited them, and bent \nthem into bones to be covered with dirt.\n“He looks like Stephanie Crawford with her hands on her hips,” I said. “Fat in the \nmiddle and little-bitty arms.”\n“I’ll make ‘em bigger.” Jem sloshed water over the mud man and added more \ndirt.

| Describe the 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level for the metric regarding an organization's inventory of information systems.                                                     | In the provided context, a consistently implemented maturity level refers to an organization where policies, procedures, and processes for developing and maintaining a comprehensive and accurate inventory of its information systems and system interconnections have been defined but are not yet fully implemented consistently across the organization. This stage indicates that some elements might be missing or incomplete, and the process may need refinement for full implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ['to assist in their FISMA evaluations. \n \nD\netermining Effectiveness with IG Metrics  \nIGs are required to assess the effectiveness of information security programs on a maturity model \nspectrum, in which the foundational levels ensure that agencies develop sound policies and \nprocedures, and at the advanced levels capture the extent that agencies institutionalize those \npolicies and procedures.  The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | In the context of the provided NIST AI security document, a white-box attack is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that a white-box attack would be an attack where the adversary has complete knowledge about the ML system, including the model architecture, parameters, and training data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nto evaluate potential mitigations. This definition is more general and encompasses the no-\ntion of adaptive attacks in which knowledge of the mitigations applied to the model or the \nsystem is explicitly tracked. \nBlack-box attacks. These attacks assume that the attacker operates with minimal, and \nsometimes no knowledge at all about the ML system. An adversary might have query \naccess to the model, but they have no other information about how the model is trained. \nThese attacks are the most practical since they assume that the attacker has no knowledge \nof the AI system and utilizes system interfaces readily available for normal use. \nGray-box attacks. There are a range of gray-box attacks that capture adversarial knowl-\nedge between black-box and white-box attacks. Suciu et al. [358] introduced a framework \nto classify gray-box attacks. An attacker might know the model architecture but not its pa-\nrameters, or the attacker might know the model and its parameters but not the training \ndata. Other common assumptions for gray-box attacks are that the attacker has access to \ndata distributed identically to the training data and knows the feature representation. The \nlatter assumption is important for applications in which feature extraction is used before \ntraining an ML model, such as cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. \n2.1.5. Data Mo dality \nUntil r\necently, most attacks and defenses in adversarial machine learning have operated \nunder a single modality, but a new trend in the field is to use multimodal data. The tax-\nonomy of attacks defined in Fig. 1 is independent of the modality of the data in specific \napplications. \nThe most common data modalities in the AML literature include: \n• Image: Adversarial examples of image data [144, 362] have the advantage of a con-\ntinuous domain, and gradient-based methods can be applied directly for optimiza-\ntion. Backdoor poisoning attacks were first invented for images [148], and many \nprivacy attacks are run on image datasets (e.g., [342]). The image modality includes \nother types of imaging (e.g., LIDAR, SAR, IR, hyperspectral). \n• Text: Text is'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | A white-box attack assumes the attacker has full knowledge of the machine learning system, including training data and architecture.

Black-Box Evasion Attacks \n[NISTAML.025] [Back to Index] \nBlack-box evasion attacks are designed under a realistic adversarial model in which the \nattacker has no prior knowledge of the model architecture or training data. Instead, the \nadversary can interact with a trained ML model by querying it on various data samples and \nobtaining the model’s predictions. Similar APIs are provided by MLaaS offered by public \ncloud providers, in which users can obtain the model’s predictions on selected queries \nwithout information about how the model was trained. There are two main classes of \nblack-box evasion attacks in the literature: \n• Score-based attacks: In this setting, attackers obtain the model’s confidence scores \nor logits and can use various optimization techniques to create the adversarial exam-\nples. A popular method is zeroth-order optimization, which estimates the model’s \ngradients without explicitly computing derivatives [80, 173]. Other optimization \ntechniques include discrete optimization [254], natural evolution strategies [172], \nand random walks [262]. \n• Decision-based attacks: In this more restrictive setting, attackers only obtain the fi-\nnal predicted labels of the model. The first method for generating evasion attacks \nwas the Boundary Attack based on random walks along the decision boundary and \nrejection sampling [47], which was extended with an improved gradient estimation \nto reduce the number of queries in the HopSkipJumpAttack [79]. More recently, sev-\neral optimization methods search for the direction of the nearest decision boundary \n(e.g., the OPT attack [86]), use sign SGD instead of binary searches (e.g., the Sign-OPT \nattack [87]), or use Bayesian optimization [344]. \nThe primary challenge in creating adversarial examples in black-box settings is re-\nducing the number of queries to the ML models. Recent techniques can success-\nfully evade the ML classifiers with a relatively small number of queries, typically \nless than 1000 [344]. \n2.2.3. Transferability of Attacks \nAnother\n method for generating adversarial attacks under restrictive threat models involves \ntransferring an attack crafted on a different ML model.

This type of attack is more practical since it assumes that the attacker has no knowledge of the AI system and utilizes system interfaces readily available for normal use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| Summarize the plot of the 'Boo Radley' game that Jem, Scout, and Dill play.                                                                                                             | The provided context suggests that Jem, Scout, and Dill create a small play based on local legends surrounding Boo Radley, a reclusive resident in their neighborhood. The game revolves around Jem taking the role of Boo Radley, sneaking into his house while the others wait outside. Scout is assigned the role of Mrs. Radley, coming out occasionally as part of the play. Dill leads Jem away and crams him beneath the steps, and plays various other characters in the story, such as the sheriff or townsfolk. The game involves dialogue and plot changes, with the children adding to it as they go along. However, no concrete events or resolution are explicitly mentioned in the context provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ['and sweep the porch. Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up and down the \nsidewalk and coughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally, was Boo: he went \nunder the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time.\nAs the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected it, added \ndialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang \nchanges every day.\nDill was a villain’s villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and \nappear tall if height was part of the devilry required. He was as good as his worst \nperformance; his worst performance was Gothic. I reluctantly played assorted \nladies who entered the script. I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I \nplayed that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jem’s assurances that \nBoo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in \nthe daytime and Atticus home at night.\nJem was a born hero.\nIt was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and \nneighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr. \nRadley and lost all her money. She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her \nright forefinger (Dill’s contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldn’t find \nany cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the \ntime, while Boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house.\nThe three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for a \nchange; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with \nthe brushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff, \nassorted townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the \nRadleys than anybody in Maycomb.\nWhen it was time to play Boo’s big scene, Jem would sneak into the house, steal \nthe scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when Calpurnia’s back was turned, \nthen sit in the swing and'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | The game is a 'melancholy little drama' based on neighborhood gossip. The plot includes scenes where Boo (played by Jem) is locked up by his father, stabs his father's leg with scissors, and is eventually stuffed up a chimney. The children play various roles, including the Radley family members, the probate judge, and Miss Stephanie Crawford. |       0.714286 |           0.877248 |                 1   |         0.666667 | token_text_splitter |

This becomes evident as they grow up and encounter more challenging situations in their lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | In the provided context, it appears that Aunt Alexandra seems to define 'Fine Folks' based on a family's lineage and the length of time they have lived in a particular place. This is contrary to Scout's (the protagonist) emerging understanding that Fine Folks are those who do their best with the sense they have, irrespective of their lineage or heritage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ['“Don’t be silly, Jean Louise,” said Aunt Alexandra. “The thing is, you can scrub \nWalter Cunningham till he shines, you can put him in shoes and a new suit, but \nhe’ll never be like Jem. Besides, there’s a drinking streak in that family a mile \nwide. Finch women aren’t interested in that sort of people.”\n“Aun-ty,” said Jem, “she ain’t nine yet.”\n“She may as well learn it now.”\nAunt Alexandra had spoken. I was reminded vividly of the last time she had put \nher foot down. I never knew why. It was when I was absorbed with plans to visit \nCalpurnia’s house—I was curious, interested; I wanted to be her “company,” to \nsee how she lived, who her friends were. I might as well have wanted to see the \nother side of the moon. This time the tactics were different, but Aunt Alexandra’s \naim was the same. Perhaps this was why she had come to live with us—to help us \nchoose our friends. I would hold her off as long as I could: “If they’re good folks, \nthen why can’t I be nice to Walter?”\n“I didn’t say not to be nice to him. You should be friendly and polite to him, you \nshould be gracious to everybody, dear. But you don’t have to invite him home.”\n“What if he was kin to us, Aunty?”\n“The fact is that he is not kin to us, but if he were, my answer would be the same.”\n“Aunty,” Jem spoke up, “Atticus says you can choose your friends but you sho‘ \ncan’t choose your family, an’ they’re still kin to you no matter whether you \nacknowledge ‘em or not, and it makes you look right silly when you don’t.”\n“That’s your father all over again,” said Aunt Alexandra, “and I still say that Jean \nLouise will not invite Walter Cunningham to this house. If he were her double \nfirst cousin once removed he would still not be received in this house unless he \ncomes to see Atticus on business.

Let a sixteen-year-old girl \ngiggle in the choir and Aunty would say, “It just goes to show you, all the \nPenfield women are flighty.” Everybody in Maycomb, it seemed, had a Streak: a \nDrinking Streak, a Gambling Streak, a Mean Streak, a Funny Streak.\nOnce, when Aunty assured us that Miss Stephanie Crawford’s tendency to mind \nother people’s business was hereditary, Atticus said, “Sister, when you stop to \nthink about it, our generation’s practically the first in the Finch family not to \nmarry its cousins. Would you say the Finches have an Incestuous Streak?”\nAunty said no, that’s where we got our small hands and feet.\nI never understood her preoccupation with heredity. Somewhere, I had received \nthe impression that Fine Folks were people who did the best they could with the \nsense they had, but Aunt Alexandra was of the opinion, obliquely expressed, that \nthe longer a family had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it was.\n“That makes the Ewells fine folks, then,” said Jem. The tribe of which Burris \nEwell and his brethren consisted had lived on the same plot of earth behind the \nMaycomb dump, and had thrived on county welfare money for three generations.\nAunt Alexandra’s theory had something behind it, though. Maycomb was an \nancient town. It was twenty miles east of Finch’s Landing, awkwardly inland for \nsuch an old town. But Maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not \nbeen for the nimble-wittedness of one Sinkfield, who in the dawn of history \noperated an inn where two pig-trails met, the only tavern in the territory. \nSinkfield, no patriot, served and supplied ammunition to Indians and settlers \nalike, neither knowing or caring whether he was a part of the Alabama Territory \nor the Creek Nation so long as business was good.

It considers the components of an AI system \nincluding the data; the model itself; the processes for training, testing, and deploying the \nmodel; and the broader software and system contexts into which models may be embed-\nded, such as cases where Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models are deployed \nwith access to private data or equipped with tools to take actions with real-world conse-\nquences. \nThus, the attacks within this taxonomy are classified relative to: (i) the AI system type, (ii) \nthe stage of the ML life cycle process in which the attack is mounted, (iii) the attacker’s \ngoals and objectives in terms of the system properties they seek to violate, (iv) the at-\ntacker’s capabilities and access, and (v) the attacker’s knowledge of the learning process \nand beyond. \nThis report adopts the concepts of security, resilience, and robustness of ML systems from \nthe NIST AI Risk Management Framework. Security, resilience, and robustness are gauged \nby risk, which is a measure of the extent to which an entity (e.g., a system) is threatened by \na potential circumstance or event (e.g., an attack) and the severity of the outcome should \nsuch an event occur .

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

Ma et al.

In the case of SUPERVISED LEARNING, labeled training data is given as \ninput to a training algorithm in the training stage, and the ML model is optimized to mini-\nmize a specific loss function. Validation and testing of the ML model is usually performed \nbefore the model is deployed in the real world. Common supervised learning techniques \ninclude CLASSIFICATION in which the predicted labels or classes are discrete and REGRESSION \nin which the predicted labels or response variables are continuous. \nOther learning paradigms in the ML literature include UNSUPERVISED LEARNING, which trains \nmodels using unlabeled data at training time; SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING in which a small \nset of examples have labels, while the majority of samples are unlabeled; REINFORCEMENT \nLEARNING in which an agent interacts with an environment and learns an optimal policy \nto maximize its reward; FEDERATED LEARNING in which a set of clients jointly train an ML \nmodel by communicating with a server that performs an aggregation of model updates; \nand ENSEMBLE LEARNING, which is an approach that seeks better predictive performance by \ncombining the predictions from multiple models. \nMost PredAI models are DISCRIMINATIVE, i.e., learn only a decision boundary, such as LOGIS-\nTIC REGRESSION, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, and CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS. GenAI \nmodels may also be used in predictive tasks, such as sentiment analysis [125] . \nAML literature predominantly considers adversarial attacks against AI systems that could \noccur at either the training stage or the deployment stage. During the training stage, the \nattacker might control part of the training data, their labels, the model parameters, or \nthe code of ML algorithms, resulting in different types of poisoning attacks. During the \ndeployment stage, the ML model is already trained, and the adversary could mount evasion \nattacks to create integrity violations and change the ML model’s predictions, as well as \nprivacy attacks to infer sensitive information about the training data or the ML model. \nTraining-time attacks. POISONING ATTACKS [40] occur during the ML training stage. In a \nDATA POISONING attack [40, 148], an adversary controls a subset of the training data by \neither inserting or modifying training samples. In a MODEL POISONING attack [222], the \nadversary controls the model and its parameters. Data poisoning attacks are applicable \nto all learning paradigms, while model poisoning attacks are most prevalent in federated \nlearning [190], where clients send local model updates to the aggregating server, and in \nsupply-chain attacks, where malicious code may be added to the model by suppliers of \n5 '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The GenAI Stages of Learning are pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and reinforcement learning from human feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     nan        |           0.691827 |                 0.5 |       nan        | semantic_splitter   |

In GenAI moreso than in PredAI, different activities such as data col-\nlection, model training, model deployment, and application development are often carried \nout by multiple different organizations or actors. \nFor example, a common paradigm in GenAI is the use of a smaller number of foundation \nmodels to support a diverse range of downstream applications. Foundation models are \npre-trained on large-scale data using self-supervised learning in order to encode general \npatterns in text, images, or other data that may be relevant for many different applica-\ntions [311]. Data at the scale used in foundation models is often collected from a variety \nof internet sources (which attackers can target, such as in DATA POISONING attacks). \nThis generalist learning paradigm equips foundation models with a variety of capabilities \nand tendencies — many of which are desirable, but some of which may be harmful or \nunwanted by the model developer . Techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and \nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can be used after initial pre-training \nto better align the base model with human preferences and to curb undesirable or harmful \nmodel outputs [281] (see Fig. 3). However, these interventions can later be targeted using \nAML techniques by attackers seeking to recover or re-enable potentially harmful capabili-\nties. \nDevelopers can make trained foundation models available to downstream users and de-\nvelopers in a variety of ways, including openly releasing the model’s weights for re-use and \n36 ']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

In this stage, there may not be consistent policies or procedures established, and the implementation of controls is likely inconsistent across the organization. This maturity level is considered the most basic level of development for a given process or system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ['The steps provided \nare ones that have been used by experienced assessors and align to the maturity level and criteria \nfor success. \n \nT\nhe guide is a companion document to the FY 2025 IG FISMA metrics1 and OMB M-25-042 \nwhich provides guidance to IGs to assist in their FISMA evaluations. \n \nD\netermining Effectiveness with IG Metrics  \nIGs are required to assess the effectiveness of information security programs on a maturity model \nspectrum, in which the foundational levels ensure that agencies develop sound policies and \nprocedures, and at the advanced levels capture the extent that agencies institutionalize those \npolicies and procedures.  The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.  For example, “The Agency \n \n1 Final FY 2025 IG FISMA Reporting Metrics (cisa.gov) \n2 Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-25-04 \n3 NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations \n '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | The five maturity levels are Ad Hoc (Level 1), Defined (Level 2), Consistently Implemented (Level 3), Managed and Measurable (Level 4), and Optimized (Level 5).                                                                                                                                                                                         |       1        |           0.895846 |                 1   |       nan        | semantic_splitter   |

These are demonstrations of evasion vulnerabilities by researchers, \nbut did not result in attacks in the wild. \n2.2.5. Mitigations \nMitig\nating evasion attacks is challenging because adversarial examples are widespread in \na variety of ML model architectures and application domains. Possible explanations for \nthe existence of adversarial examples are that ML models rely on non-robust features that \nare not aligned with human perception in the computer vision domain [174]. In the last \nfew years, many of the proposed mitigations against adversarial examples have been in-\neffective against stronger attacks. Furthermore, several papers have performed extensive \nevaluations and defeated a large number of proposed mitigations: \n• Carlini and Wagner showed how to bypass 10 methods for detecting adversarial ex-\namples and described several guidelines for evaluating defenses [64]. Recent work \nshows that detecting adversarial examples is as difficult as building a defense [373]. \nTherefore, this direction for mitigating adversarial examples is similarly challenging \nas designing defenses. \n• The Obfuscated Gradients attack [20] was specifically designed to defeat several pro-\nposed defenses that rely on masking gradients to protect against optimization-based \nattacks. It relies on a new technique, Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation, \nwhich approximates the gradient during the backward pass of backpropagation, and \nwas shown to bypass several proposed defenses based on gradient masking. \n• Tramèr et al.

They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here.

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.

Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022. The goal of this new framework was to provide a more flexible \nbut continued focus on annual assessments for the federal community.

| What are the two broad classes of AI systems distinguished in the NIST AI 100-2e2025 report?                                                                                            | The provided context does not explicitly mention any two broad classes of AI systems distinguished in the NIST AI 100-2e2025 report. However, it is suggested that the term "system" may have a broader meaning in this document, referring to the organizational and/or social ecosystem within which the technology was designed, developed, deployed, and used. Without further information or additional context, it's not possible to definitively say what specific broad classes of AI systems are distinguished in the NIST AI 100-2e2025 report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ['How to Read This Document \nThis document uses the terms “AI technology,” “AI system,” and “AI applications” inter-\nchangeably.

They advocate for de-\nsigning adaptive attacks to test newly proposed defenses rather than merely testing \nthe defenses against well-known attacks. \nFrom the wide range of proposed defenses against adversarial evasion attacks, three main \nclasses have proven to be resilient and have the potential to provide mitigation against \nevasion attacks: \n1. Adversarial training: Introduced by Goodfellow et al. [144] and further developed \nby Madry et al. [232], adversarial training is a general method that augments train-\ning data with adversarial examples generated iteratively during training using their \ncorrect labels. The stronger the adversarial attacks for generating adversarial exam-\nples are, the more resilient the trained model becomes. Adversarial training results \nin models with more semantic meaning than standard models [379], but this benefit \nusually comes at the cost of decreased model accuracy on clean data. Additionally, \nadversarial training is expensive due to the iterative generation of adversarial exam-\nples during training. \n2.

He died years ago and they stuffed him up the chimney.”\nDill said, “Jem, you and me can play and Scout can watch if she’s scared.”\nI was fairly sure Boo Radley was inside that house, but I couldn’t prove it, and \nfelt it best to keep my mouth shut or I would be accused of believing in Hot \nSteams, phenomena I was immune to in the daytime.\nJem parceled out our roles: I was Mrs. Radley, and all I had to do was come out '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Arthur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     nan        |           0        |                 0   |       nan        | semantic_splitter   |

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here.

He had been lying on the grass. “You \nlittle folks won’t tell on me now, will you? It’d ruin my reputation if you did.”\n“You mean all you drink in that sack’s Coca-Cola?

However, if you need help calculating it, you can look up the year-day numbering system and find the day of the week for any given date. For example, January 1 is always a Monday in a non-leap year, while it's a Sunday in a leap year. Christmas Day, December 25, will fall on a different day each year depending on the specific year (2025 in this case).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ['the facts.\nThere are no clearly defined seasons in South Alabama; summer drifts into \nautumn, and autumn is sometimes never followed by winter, but turns to a days-\nold spring that melts into summer again.

Walk back in your tracks, though,” he cautioned.\n“Are we gonna have a snow baby, Jem?”\n“No, a real snowman. Gotta work hard, now.”\nJem ran to the back yard, produced the garden hoe and began digging quickly \nbehind the woodpile, placing any worms he found to one side. He went in the \nhouse, returned with the laundry hamper, filled it with earth and carried it to the \nfront yard.\nWhen we had five baskets of earth and two baskets of snow, Jem said we were \nready to begin.\n“Don’t you think this is kind of a mess?” I asked.\n“Looks messy now, but it won’t later,” he said.\nJem scooped up an armful of dirt, patted it into a mound on which he added \nanother load, and another until he had constructed a torso.\n“Jem, I ain’t ever heard of a nigger snowman,” I said.\n“He won’t be black long,” he grunted.\nJem procured some peachtree switches from the back yard, plaited them, and bent \nthem into bones to be covered with dirt.\n“He looks like Stephanie Crawford with her hands on her hips,” I said. “Fat in the \nmiddle and little-bitty arms.”\n“I’ll make ‘em bigger.” Jem sloshed water over the mud man and added more \ndirt. He looked thoughtfully at it for a moment, then he molded a big stomach \nbelow the figure’s waistline.

Assessors should assess these policies and procedures to \ndetermine whether system boundary considerations (e.g., bundling, mobile devices, cloud deployments, etc.) are outlined for \ninventorying.   These policy documents should also outline processes associated with registering information systems and maintaining \nthe organization's information system inventory.  Artifacts that support maintaining a current system inventory include those gathered \nfrom FISMA compliance tools (e.g., Cybersecurity Assessment and Management (CSAM) and other tools that may be deployed to \ncapture component inventory information, infrastructure configuration management processes, SDLC processes, EA processes, and \nmay be captured in a general Information Security Program policy. \n \nConsistently Implemented:  As part of the analysis performed by the assessor for public facing web applications, utilize open-source \ntools/information (e.g., digitaldashboard.gov) to identify the agencies subdomains and related services and compare against the \ninventory of information maintained by the agency for completeness and accuracy.  The assessor should determine if the inventory \nwas approved and completed and maintained in accordance with agency policies and procedures.  Determine if the system level \ninventories reconcile to the organization-wide system inventory.  Evidence collected should demonstrate that the agency used the \nGSA list of non .gov agency websites to reconcile against its approved inventory of webapps/websites sites and performed \nappropriate actions to update and respond to newly discovered websites/apps.  Assessors should use the CISA provided data about \nagencies’ internet-accessible assets data to evaluate the completeness of the public web app inventory.  Assessors may also consider \nreviewing change control ticket, FedRAMP PMO communications, and EA documentation to confirm the completeness of the \napproved system inventory (including those hosted on-prem).  Assessors should also consider reviewing FISMA compliance tools \n(e.g., CSAM) records, EA documentation, SDLC/change control records, etc. to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the \ninventory.   \n \n"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | At the 'Consistently Implemented' level, the organization consistently implements its policies, procedures, and processes to maintain a comprehensive and accurate inventory of its information systems, including cloud systems, public-facing websites, and third-party systems, and system interconnections.                                          |       1        |           0.765711 |                 1   |       nan        | semantic_splitter   |

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | In the context provided, a white-box attack is not explicitly defined but can be inferred to be an attack scenario where the adversary has comprehensive knowledge about the ML system, including model architecture, parameters, and training data. On the other hand, a black-box attack assumes that the attacker operates with minimal or no knowledge about the ML system. The attacker might have query access to the model but lacks information about how it was trained. Therefore, the main difference lies in the level of knowledge the adversary possesses about the targeted ML system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ['Black-box attacks. These attacks assume that the attacker operates with minimal, and \nsometimes no knowledge at all about the ML system. An adversary might have query \naccess to the model, but they have no other information about how the model is trained. \nThese attacks are the most practical since they assume that the attacker has no knowledge \nof the AI system and utilizes system interfaces readily available for normal use. \nGray-box attacks. There are a range of gray-box attacks that capture adversarial knowl-\nedge between black-box and white-box attacks. Suciu et al. [358] introduced a framework \nto classify gray-box attacks. An attacker might know the model architecture but not its pa-\nrameters, or the attacker might know the model and its parameters but not the training \ndata. Other common assumptions for gray-box attacks are that the attacker has access to \ndata distributed identically to the training data and knows the feature representation. The \nlatter assumption is important for applications in which feature extraction is used before \ntraining an ML model, such as cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. \n'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | A white-box attack assumes the attacker has full knowledge of the machine learning system, including training data and architecture.

Black-Box Evasion Attacks \n[NISTAML.025] [Back to Index] \nBlack-box evasion attacks are designed under a realistic adversarial model in which the \nattacker has no prior knowledge of the model architecture or training data. Instead, the \nadversary can interact with a trained ML model by querying it on various data samples and \nobtaining the model’s predictions. Similar APIs are provided by MLaaS offered by public \ncloud providers, in which users can obtain the model’s predictions on selected queries \nwithout information about how the model was trained. There are two main classes of \nblack-box evasion attacks in the literature: \n• Score-based attacks: In this setting, attackers obtain the model’s confidence scores \nor logits and can use various optimization techniques to create the adversarial exam-\nples. A popular method is zeroth-order optimization, which estimates the model’s \ngradients without explicitly computing derivatives [80, 173]. Other optimization \ntechniques include discrete optimization [254], natural evolution strategies [172], \nand random walks [262]. \n• Decision-based attacks: In this more restrictive setting, attackers only obtain the fi-\nnal predicted labels of the model. The first method for generating evasion attacks \nwas the Boundary Attack based on random walks along the decision boundary and \nrejection sampling [47], which was extended with an improved gradient estimation \nto reduce the number of queries in the HopSkipJumpAttack [79]. More recently, sev-\neral optimization methods search for the direction of the nearest decision boundary \n(e.g., the OPT attack [86]), use sign SGD instead of binary searches (e.g., the Sign-OPT \nattack [87]), or use Bayesian optimization [344]. \nThe primary challenge in creating adversarial examples in black-box settings is re-\nducing the number of queries to the ML models. Recent techniques can success-\nfully evade the ML classifiers with a relatively small number of queries, typically \nless than 1000 [344]. \n2.2.3. Transferability of Attacks \nAnother\n method for generating adversarial attacks under restrictive threat models involves \ntransferring an attack crafted on a different ML model. Typically, an attacker trains a sub-\nstitute ML model, generates white-box adversarial attacks on the substitute model, and \ntransfers the attacks to the target model. Various methods differ in how the substitute \nmodels are trained.

He died years ago and they stuffed him up the chimney.”\nDill said, “Jem, you and me can play and Scout can watch if she’s scared.”\nI was fairly sure Boo Radley was inside that house, but I couldn’t prove it, and \nfelt it best to keep my mouth shut or I would be accused of believing in Hot \nSteams, phenomena I was immune to in the daytime.\nJem parceled out our roles: I was Mrs. Radley, and all I had to do was come out '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | The game is a 'melancholy little drama' based on neighborhood gossip.

She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her \nright forefinger (Dill’s contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldn’t find \nany cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the \ntime, while Boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house.\nThe three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for a \nchange; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with \nthe brushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff, \nassorted townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the \nRadleys than anybody in Maycomb.\nWhen it was time to play Boo’s big scene, Jem would sneak into the house, steal \nthe scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when Calpurnia’s back was turned, \nthen sit in the swing and cut up newspapers. Dill would walk by, cough at Jem, \nand Jem would fake a plunge into Dill’s thigh. From where I stood it looked real.\nWhen Mr. Nathan Radley passed us on his daily trip to town, we would stand still \nand silent until he was out of sight, then wonder what he would do to us if he \nsuspected.

| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | In the provided context, Aunt Alexandra does not explicitly define what she means by "fine folks". However, her statement suggests that they are people who are not part of their social circle or family. This is contrasted with Scout's perspective, as shown when she asks why Aunt Alexandra considers them 'good folks but not our kind of folks'. Scout seems to interpret this as meaning they are not refined or sophisticated, which she associates with the term 'yappy', as explained by Jem. However, it is important to note that the exact definitions and contrasts between Aunt Alexandra's and Scout's understanding remain implicit in the provided text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ['“Don’t be silly, Jean Louise,” said Aunt Alexandra. “The thing is, you can scrub \nWalter Cunningham till he shines, you can put him in shoes and a new suit, but \nhe’ll never be like Jem. Besides, there’s a drinking streak in that family a mile \nwide. Finch women aren’t interested in that sort of people.”\n“Aun-ty,” said Jem, “she ain’t nine yet.”\n“She may as well learn it now.”\nAunt Alexandra had spoken.

| According to the NIST document, what are some examples of privacy compromise attacks in predictive AI systems?                                                                          | The context suggests that data privacy attacks refer to attacks against machine learning models that extract sensitive information about training data [7]. In predictive AI systems, this could potentially include attacks related to data poisoning as the document mentions data poisoning in relation to predictive AI systems [5, 36, 37, 40, 111].

This can be targeted, where the adversary selects the new class for the adversarial example, or untargeted, where the adversarial example is misclassified to any other incorrect class. The document also mentions that these examples are widespread in various ML model architectures and application domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \ntack the real system.

That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | A Mockingbird.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     nan        |           0.91404  |                 1   |       nan        | recursive_character |

| Describe the 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level for the metric regarding an organization's inventory of information systems.                                                     | The provided context does not explicitly define or discuss a specific maturity level called "Consistently Implemented" with regards to an organization's inventory of information systems. However, it does mention the evaluation of maturity levels for various metrics, and alternative evidence approaches could complement traditional documentation, which suggests that there might be multiple levels of maturity for different aspects related to an organization's information systems management. It is not possible to determine more specific details without further context or additional information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ['modification, or destruction of information systems used or operated by their agency or on behalf \nof their agency by a contractor or other organization. \n \nA\nlternative Evidence Considerations \nWhile the tables below provide recommended types of evidence for evaluating maturity levels, \nIGs should consider accepting additional forms of evidence that effectively demonstrate \ncapability maturity.

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | In the provided document, a white-box attack refers to an attack where the adversary has comprehensive knowledge of the ML system, including the model's architecture and its weights. Conversely, a black-box attack assumes that the attacker has minimal or no knowledge about the underlying ML model. The attacker may only have access to system interfaces typically used for normal operations. Gray-box attacks fall somewhere in between these two extremes, with varying levels of knowledge about the AI system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ['These attacks are the most practical since they assume that the attacker has no knowledge \nof the AI system and utilizes system interfaces readily available for normal use. \nGray-box attacks.

| Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23.                                                      | In the provided context, neither Jem nor Scout directly discuss their views on what makes 'folks' different from one another in Chapter 23. However, we can infer that they are aware of differences in financial status, as demonstrated by Atticus discussing how certain individuals like Dr. Reynolds and the Cunninghams provide their services (legal or medical) in return for payment in kind, such as bushels of potatoes. This suggests that Jem and Scout understand that some people might not have money but can offer other forms of compensation.

| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | In the provided context, Aunt Alexandra doesn't explicitly define what she means by "fine folks." However, her statement, "They’re not our kind of folks," suggests that they are not part of their social circle or community, rather than a moral judgment about them being good or bad. This contrasts with Scout's understanding as she expresses confusion and surprise at this distinction, suggesting that she doesn't yet understand the social boundaries Aunt Alexandra is referring to. The additional context provided by Jem explains that "our kind of folks" are people who aren't considered tacky or refined enough, and there may be a drinking problem in their family, which is why they are not welcomed into the Finch family circle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ['with us sometime, okay, Jem?”\n“We’ll see about that,” Aunt Alexandra said, a declaration that with her was \nalways a threat, never a promise.

| What are the three main attacker objectives in the taxonomy of attacks on predictive AI (PredAI) systems as defined in the NIST document?                                               | In the provided context, it doesn't explicitly mention the specific number of attacker objectives within the taxonomy of attacks on Predictive AI (PredAI) systems. However, based on the information given, we can infer that the taxonomy is categorized based on attacker goals and objectives (as mentioned in Figure 1), so it would be reasonable to assume there are multiple objectives. The context does not specify a particular number of objectives, though.

This will help both parties reach an updated, mutually agreed-upon management decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ['7 \n \nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL \ncases it’s recommended that agency officials renegotiate the new planned corrective actions with \nOIG officials to develop an updated, agreed upon management decision.   \n \nWh\nat should OIGs and agencies do if a recommendation is overcome by events (OBE)?'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | The OIG should consider closing the recommendation with a status of 'Unresolved - Closed' and, if appropriate, issue an updated and refocused recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                            |       0.8      |           0.901213 |                 1   |       nan        | hierarchical        |

| What are the six cybersecurity functions that Inspectors General use to determine an agency's effectiveness?                                                                            | The provided context does not explicitly list six specific cybersecurity functions used by Inspectors General to determine an agency's effectiveness. However, it can be inferred from the questions presented on pages 8 and 17 that these functions may include the development and maintenance of cybersecurity profiles (for understanding, tailoring, assessing, prioritizing, and communicating cybersecurity objectives), as well as establishing cybersecurity roles, responsibilities, and authorities that foster accountability, performance assessment, and continuous improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ['8 \n \nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL \nCybersecurity Governance \n1.

| Summarize the plot of the 'Boo Radley' game that Jem, Scout, and Dill play.                                                                                                             | The provided text does not contain enough details to summarize a specific "game" between Jem, Scout, and Dill involving Boo Radley. However, it is implied that they discuss the idea of making Boo Radley come out from his mysterious residence, known as the Radley Place, presumably as an exciting or adventurous endeavor. The motivation for this appears to stem from Dill's fascination with the Radley Place and Jem using this as a way to highlight his bravery compared to Scout's perceived cowardice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ['But by the end of August our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions, \nand it was then that Dill gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.\nThe Radley Place fascinated Dill.

However, it is evident that they have grown to perceive certain things differently. For instance, Scout mentions going to visit Atticus in court regarding Tom Robinson's case, which shows her concern for justice, while Jem appears more detached and prefers reading the paper instead (page_label: 118).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ['all I can say is, when you and Jem are grown, maybe you’ll look \nback on this with some compassion and some feeling that I didn’t let you down. \nThis case, Tom Robinson’s case, is something that goes to the essence of a man’s \nconscience—Scout, I couldn’t go to church and worship God if I didn’t try to help \nthat man.”\n“Atticus,'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Jem believes there are four kinds of folks, separated by class and race (e.g., ordinary like the Finches, Cunninghams, Ewells, and Negroes), and that background is determined by how long a family has been literate.

Their unique perspectives will likely continue to develop throughout the novel, To Kill a Mockingbird.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | Based on the provided context, Aunt Alexandra seems to consider "Fine Folks" as those who have a long-standing history on a particular piece of land. This definition appears to contrast with Scout's understanding, which is more about individuals doing their best with what they have, as evidenced by her statement that Fine Folks are people who do the best they can with the sense they have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ['I never understood her preoccupation with heredity.
