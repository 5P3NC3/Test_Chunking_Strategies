Recently, Balle et al. [26] trained \na reconstructor network that can recover a data sample from a neural network model, as-\nsuming that a powerful adversary has information about all other training samples. Haim \net al. [152] showed how the training data of a binary neural network classifier can be re-\nconstructed from access to the model parameters by leveraging theoretical insights about \nimplicit bias in neural networks. This work has recently been extended to reconstruct train-\ning samples of multi-class multi-layer perceptron classifiers [50]. Attribute inference is \nanother relevant privacy attack in which the attacker extracts a sensitive attribute of the \ntraining set, assuming partial knowledge about other features in the training data [184]. \nThe ability to reconstruct training samples is partially explained by the tendency of neural \nnetworks to memorize their training data. Zhang et al. [431] discussed how neural net-\nworks can memorize randomly selected datasets. Feldman [126] showed that the mem-\norization of training labels is necessary to achieve an almost optimal generalization error \nin ML. Brown et al. [48] constructed two learning tasks based on next-symbol prediction \nand cluster labeling in which memorization is required for high-accuracy learning. Feldman \nand Zhang empirically evaluated the benefit of memorization for generalization using an \ninfluence estimation method [127]. Data reconstruction attacks and their connection to \nmemorization for generative AI are discussed in Sec. 3.3.2. \n2.4.2. Memb ership Inference \n[NISTAML.033]\n [Back to Index] \nMembership inference attacks may expose private information about an individual, like re-\nconstruction or memorization attacks, and are of great concern when releasing aggregate \ninformation or ML models trained on user data. In certain situations, determining that an \nindividual is part of the training set already has privacy implications, such as in a medical \nstudy of patients with a rare disease.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The embedding model to be used is bge-m3:567m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     nan        |           0        |            0        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

For example, rows from a database \nor text from a PDF document that are intended to be summarized generically by the LLM \ncan be verbosely extracted by simply asking for them via direct prompting, or performing \nsimple prompting attacks. \nModel extraction. As in PredAI (Sec. 2.4.4), attackers may perform MODEL EXTRACTION at-\ntacks which attempt to learn information about the model architecture and parameters by \nsubmitting specially-crafted queries. Recently, Carlini et al. [61] demonstrated that such \ninformation could be extracted from black-box production LLMs, deriving previously un-\nknown hidden dimensions and the embedding projection layer (up to symmetries). \n47']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Multiple attack classes that require the \nsame capabilities to reach the same objective are shown in a single callout. \nThese attacks are classified according to the following dimensions: 1) learning method and \nstage of the learning process when the attack is mounted, 2) attacker goals and objectives, \n4'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The three main attacker objectives are availability breakdown, integrity violation, and privacy compromise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       1        |           1        |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

This report is not intended to provide \nan exhaustive survey of all available literature on Adversarial ML, which includes \nmore than 11,354 references on arXiv.org since 2021 as of July 2024. \nThis report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems. Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques.

Backdoor attacks are the only attacks in the literature that require both training \nand testing data control. Model poisoning attacks could result in either targeted or back-\ndoor attacks, and the attacker modifies model parameters to cause an integrity violation. \nThey have been designed for centralized learning [222] and federated learning [22, 36]. \nPrivacy compromise [NISTAML.03] [Back to Index]. A PRIVACY COMPROMISE attack causes \nthe unintended leakage of restricted or proprietary information from a PredAI system, in-\ncluding details about a model’s training data, weights, or architecture [100, 309]. While \nthe term “confidentiality” is more widely used in taxonomies of traditional cybersecurity \nattacks, the AML field has tended to use the top-level term “privacy” to encompass both \nattacks against the confidentiality of a model (e.g., those that extract information about a \nmodel’s weights or architecture) and those that cause violations of expected privacy prop-\nerties of model outputs (e.g. by exposing model training data) [310]. DATA CONFIDENTIAL-\nITY during ML training can be achieved through secure computation methods based on \ncryptographic techniques [2, 253, 288, 385], which ensure that training data and model \nparameters remain protected during the training phase. However, even models trained \nusing paradigms that enforce data confidentiality may be vulnerable to privacy attacks, in \nwhich adversaries interacting with a model can extract information about its training data \nor parameters. In this report, we focus on privacy compromises that can occur at deploy-\nment time, regardless of the training method used, or whether data confidentiality was \nmaintained during training. \nIn privacy attacks, attackers might be interested in learning information about the training \ndata (resulting in DATA PRIVACY ATTACKS) or the ML model (resulting in MODEL PRIVACY AT-\nTACKS).'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Examples include data reconstruction, membership-inference attacks, training data extraction, attribute inference attacks, and property inference.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |       1        |           0.667761 |            1        |         1        | sentence_splitter   |

In GenAI moreso than in PredAI, different activities such as data col-\nlection, model training, model deployment, and application development are often carried \nout by multiple different organizations or actors. \nFor example, a common paradigm in GenAI is the use of a smaller number of foundation \nmodels to support a diverse range of downstream applications. Foundation models are \npre-trained on large-scale data using self-supervised learning in order to encode general \npatterns in text, images, or other data that may be relevant for many different applica-\ntions [311]. Data at the scale used in foundation models is often collected from a variety \nof internet sources (which attackers can target, such as in DATA POISONING attacks). \nThis generalist learning paradigm equips foundation models with a variety of capabilities \nand tendencies — many of which are desirable, but some of which may be harmful or \nunwanted by the model developer . Techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and \nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can be used after initial pre-training \nto better align the base model with human preferences and to curb undesirable or harmful \nmodel outputs [281] (see Fig. 3).'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The GenAI Stages of Learning are pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and reinforcement learning from human feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       0.6      |           0.792657 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age.

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022. The goal of this new framework was to provide a more flexible \nbut continued focus on annual assessments for the federal community.

The guide also includes suggested types of \nanalysis that IGs may perform to assess capabilities in given areas.  The guide should be \nconsidered for suggested source evidence that IGs may request to answer a metric.  The guide \nshould not be considered as an all-inclusive list of source evidence or test methods to reach the \nvarious maturity levels within metrics and domains.  The test methods are not all inclusive and \nmay not apply in all situations.  Additional sources such as penetration testing and red team \nassessment results may be effective sources of evidence for select metrics.  \n \nTh\ne “Assessor’s Best Practices” section has replaced the “Additional Notes” section this year.  \nThis section now breaks out the four maturity levels beyond Ad-Hoc to provide the assessor \nspecific evaluation steps to consider for consistent assessment and testing.

Further, IGs should explain in CyberScope the impact this has on the IGs \nability to determine the effectiveness of their agency’s information security program.  \n \nTh\ne tables below show the IG metrics for FY25 IG evaluation period.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The OIG should consider closing the recommendation with a status of 'Unresolved - Closed' and, if appropriate, issue an updated and refocused recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                            |       1        |           0.981159 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

As a general best practice, broad recommendations should be \navoided.  Recommendations should be focused on specific actions to address the root cause and \nlead the agency to that next maturity level.  It may require several recommendations to get that \nmetric to the next level, however this provides the agency with specific guidance and the \nopportunity to make steady and visible progress.  This approach would also allow the assessors \nto follow-up on agency actions taken as part of their recommendation follow-up processes and/or \nthe next FISMA evaluation.  It is a matter of opinion, however generally a higher quantity of \nspecific recommendations is preferable over fewer broad recommendations.  \n \nH\now should agencies consider plans of action and milestone (POA&M)? \nAs part of the data collection process, it is recommended that assessors collect and consider open \nPOA&Ms that the organization has self-identified (or other means, such as past GAO or OIG \nreports, or assessment and authorization reviews) as issues they are working to resolve.  As a \nbest practice, assessors should avoid issuing recommendations that the organization is aware of \nand actively working to resolve.  To re-emphasize the open POA&M assessors should consider \nreferencing them in the narrative write up.  Another potential approach would be to issue an \n“Opportunity for Improvement” (OFI) or an “Item for Management’s Consideration” (IMC) to \nstate that the organization should prioritize the POA&M in order to continue to mature the \nmetric, domain, or program.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022.

The taxonomy is arranged in a \nconceptual hierarchy that includes key types of ML methods, life cycle stages of attack, and attacker \ngoals, objectives, capabilities, and knowledge. This report also identifies current challenges in the life \ncycle of AI systems and describes corresponding methods for mitigating and managing the \nconsequences of those attacks.

These challenges span different phases of ML operations such \nas the potential for adversarial manipulation of training data; the provision of adversar-\nial inputs to adversely affect the performance of the AI system; and even malicious ma-\nnipulations, modifications, or interactions with models to exfiltrate sensitive information \nfrom the model’s training data or to which the model has access. Such attacks have been \ndemonstrated under real-world conditions, and their sophistication and impacts have been \nincreasing steadily. \nThe field of AML is concerned with studying these attacks. It must consider the capabilities \nof attackers, the model or system properties that attackers might seek to violate in pursuit \nof their objectives, and the design of attack methods that exploit vulnerabilities during the \ndevelopment, training, and deployment phases of the ML life cycle. It is also concerned \nwith the design of ML algorithms and systems that can withstand these security and privacy \nchallenges, a property often known as robustness [274]. \nTo taxonimize these attacks, this report differentiates between predictive and generative \nAI systems and the attacks relevant to each. It considers the components of an AI system \nincluding the data; the model itself; the processes for training, testing, and deploying the \nmodel; and the broader software and system contexts into which models may be embed-\nded, such as cases where Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models are deployed \nwith access to private data or equipped with tools to take actions with real-world conse-\nquences.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| In the context of Generative AI, what is a 'jailbreak'?                                                                                                                                 | In the given context, a jailbreak refers to an instance where a generative model manages to bypass or manipulate safety mechanisms, potentially leading to harmful outputs. This could happen when an attacker uses a high-quality classifier to train another generative model to produce such outputs. The term 'jailbreak' is used metaphorically here, as it implies breaking out of the intended constraints or safe operation area of the AI model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ['When the attacker has access to a high-quality classifier \nthat judges whether model output is harmful, it may be used as a reward function to \ntrain a generative model to generate jailbreaks of another generative model. Only \nquery access is required for each of the models, and no human intervention is re-\nquired to update or refine a candidate jailbreak. The prompts may also be transfer-\nable from the target model to other closed-source LLMs [73]. \nThe Crescendo attack [316] introduced the idea of interacting with the model itera-\ntively in a multi-turn adaptive attack that includes seemingly benign prompts, even-\ntually leading to a successful jailbreak against safety alignment. The initial manual \nattack is fully automated by leveraging another LLM for prompt generation and in-\ncorporating multiple input sources. \n45'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | A jailbreak is a direct prompting attack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as bypassing refusal behavior to enable misuse.                                                                                                                                                                                               |       0.75     |           0.948054 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

This report is not intended to provide \nan exhaustive survey of all available literature on Adversarial ML, which includes \nmore than 11,354 references on arXiv.org since 2021 as of July 2024. \nThis report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems. Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques. The intent is to raise awareness of open questions in the \nfield of AML and to call attention to trends that may shape risk and risk management \npractices in future. \n3'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The three main classes of defenses against evasion attacks are adversarial training, randomized smoothing, and formal verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       0.8      |           0.968862 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

These are demonstrations of evasion vulnerabilities by researchers, \nbut did not result in attacks in the wild. \n2.2.5. Mitigations \nMitig\nating evasion attacks is challenging because adversarial examples are widespread in \na variety of ML model architectures and application domains. Possible explanations for \nthe existence of adversarial examples are that ML models rely on non-robust features that \nare not aligned with human perception in the computer vision domain [174]. In the last \nfew years, many of the proposed mitigations against adversarial examples have been in-\neffective against stronger attacks. Furthermore, several papers have performed extensive \nevaluations and defeated a large number of proposed mitigations: \n• Carlini and Wagner showed how to bypass 10 methods for detecting adversarial ex-\namples and described several guidelines for evaluating defenses [64]. Recent work \nshows that detecting adversarial examples is as difficult as building a defense [373]. \nTherefore, this direction for mitigating adversarial examples is similarly challenging \nas designing defenses. \n• The Obfuscated Gradients attack [20] was specifically designed to defeat several pro-\nposed defenses that rely on masking gradients to protect against optimization-based \nattacks. It relies on a new technique, Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation, \nwhich approximates the gradient during the backward pass of backpropagation, and \nwas shown to bypass several proposed defenses based on gradient masking. \n• Tramèr et al. [375] described a methodology for designing adaptive attacks against \nproposed defenses and circumvented 13 existing defenses. They advocate for de-\nsigning adaptive attacks to test newly proposed defenses rather than merely testing \nthe defenses against well-known attacks. \nFrom the wide range of proposed defenses against adversarial evasion attacks, three main \nclasses have proven to be resilient and have the potential to provide mitigation against \nevasion attacks: \n1.

He said Atticus never talked \nmuch about the Radleys: when Jem would question him Atticus’s only answer \nwas for him to mind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a \nright to; but when it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said, “Mm, \nmm, mm.”\nSo Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford, a \nneighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing. According to Miss \nStephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from The \nMaycomb Tribune to paste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr. \nRadley passed by, Boo drove the scissors into his parent’s leg, pulled them out, \nwiped them on his pants, and resumed his activities.\nMrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but \nwhen the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the \nTribune. He was thirty-three years old then.\nMiss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum, \nwhen it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo \nwasn’t crazy, he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr. \nRadley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not \na criminal. The sheriff hadn’t the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so \nBoo was locked in the courthouse basement.\nBoo’s transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jem’s memory. \nMiss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he \ndidn’t take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could \nnot live forever on the bounty of the county.\nNobody knew what form of intimidation Mr.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Arthur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     nan        |           0        |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

He was a thin leathery man with \ncolorless eyes, so colorless they did not reflect light. His cheekbones were sharp \nand his mouth was wide, with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip. Miss Stephanie \nCrawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as his only law, and we \nbelieved her, because Mr. Radley’s posture was ramrod straight.\nHe never spoke to us. When he passed we would look at the ground and say, \n“Good morning, sir,” and he would cough in reply. Mr. Radley’s elder son lived \nin Pensacola; he came home at Christmas, and he was one of the few persons we \never saw enter or leave the place. From the day Mr. Radley took Arthur home, \npeople said the house died.\nBut there came a day when Atticus told us he’d wear us out if we made any noise \nin the yard and commissioned Calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a \nsound out of us. Mr. Radley was dying.\nHe took his time about it. Wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the \nRadley lot, straw was put down on the sidewalk, traffic was diverted to the back \nstreet. Dr. Reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the \nRadley’s every time he called. Jem and I crept around the yard for days. At last \nthe sawhorses were taken away, and we stood watching from the front porch \nwhen Mr. Radley made his final journey past our house.\n“There goes the meanest man ever God blew breath into,” murmured Calpurnia, \nand she spat meditatively into the yard. We looked at her in surprise, for \nCalpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people.\nThe neighborhood thought when Mr. Radley went under Boo would come out, \nbut it had another think coming: Boo’s elder brother returned from Pensacola and \ntook Mr. Radley’s place.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

I followed him. “Hasn’t passed by yet,” he said.\nNext day Jem repeated his vigil and was rewarded.\n“Hidy do, Mr. Nathan,” he said.\n“Morning Jem, Scout,” said Mr. Radley, as he went by.\n“Mr. Radley,” said Jem.\nMr. Radley turned around.\n“Mr. Radley, ah—did you put cement in that hole in that tree down yonder?”\n“Yes,” he said. “I filled it up.”\n“Why’d you do it, sir?”\n“Tree’s dying. You plug ‘em with cement when they’re sick. You ought to know \nthat, Jem.”\nJem said nothing more about it until late afternoon. When we passed our tree he \ngave it a meditative pat on its cement, and remained deep in thought. He seemed \nto be working himself into a bad humor, so I kept my distance.\nAs usual, we met Atticus coming home from work that evening. When we were at \nour steps Jem said, “Atticus, look down yonder at that tree, please sir.”\n“What tree, son?”\n“The one on the corner of the Radley lot comin‘ from school.”\n“Yes?”\n“Is that tree dyin‘?”\n“Why no, son, I don’t think so. Look at the leaves, they’re all green and full, no \nbrown patches anywhere—”\n“It ain’t even sick?”\n“That tree’s as healthy as you are, Jem. Why?”\n“Mr. Nathan Radley said it was dyin‘.”\n“Well maybe it is. I’m sure Mr. Radley knows more about his trees than we do.”\nAtticus left us on the porch.

When we went home, Jem put the dolls in his trunk.\nLess than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum, which we \nenjoyed, the fact that everything on the Radley Place was poison having slipped \nJem’s memory.\nThe following week the knot-hole yielded a tarnished medal. Jem showed it to \nAtticus, who said it was a spelling medal, that before we were born the Maycomb \nCounty schools had spelling contests and awarded medals to the winners. Atticus \nsaid someone must have lost it, and had we asked around? Jem camel-kicked me \nwhen I tried to say where we had found it. Jem asked Atticus if he remembered \nanybody who ever won one, and Atticus said no.\nOur biggest prize appeared four days later. It was a pocket watch that wouldn’t \nrun, on a chain with an aluminum knife.\n“You reckon it’s white gold, Jem?”\n“Don’t know. I’ll show it to Atticus.”\nAtticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars, knife, chain and all, if it were \nnew. “Did you swap with somebody at school?” he asked.\n“Oh, no sir!” Jem pulled out his grandfather’s watch that Atticus let him carry \nonce a week if Jem were careful with it. On the days he carried the watch, Jem \nwalked on eggs. “Atticus, if it’s all right with you, I’d rather have this one instead. \nMaybe I can fix it.”\nWhen the new wore off his grandfather’s watch, and carrying it became a day’s \nburdensome task, Jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every \nfive minutes.\nHe did a fair job, only one spring and two tiny pieces left over, but the watch \nwould not run. “Oh-h,” he sighed, “it’ll never go.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood.

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | In the provided NIST AI security document, a white-box attack is contrasted with a black-box attack. A white-box attack assumes an adversary has comprehensive knowledge about the ML system, including the model architecture, its parameters, and potentially even the training data. On the other hand, a black-box attack assumes minimal or no knowledge at all about the ML system. The adversary may only have query access to the model, but they lack knowledge of how the model is trained.

This definition is more general and encompasses the no-\ntion of adaptive attacks in which knowledge of the mitigations applied to the model or the \nsystem is explicitly tracked. \nBlack-box attacks. These attacks assume that the attacker operates with minimal, and \nsometimes no knowledge at all about the ML system. An adversary might have query \naccess to the model, but they have no other information about how the model is trained. \nThese attacks are the most practical since they assume that the attacker has no knowledge \nof the AI system and utilizes system interfaces readily available for normal use. \nGray-box attacks. There are a range of gray-box attacks that capture adversarial knowl-\nedge between black-box and white-box attacks. Suciu et al. [358] introduced a framework \nto classify gray-box attacks. An attacker might know the model architecture but not its pa-\nrameters, or the attacker might know the model and its parameters but not the training \ndata. Other common assumptions for gray-box attacks are that the attacker has access to \ndata distributed identically to the training data and knows the feature representation. The \nlatter assumption is important for applications in which feature extraction is used before \ntraining an ML model, such as cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. \n2.1.5. Data Mo dality \nUntil r\necently, most attacks and defenses in adversarial machine learning have operated \nunder a single modality, but a new trend in the field is to use multimodal data. The tax-\nonomy of attacks defined in Fig. 1 is independent of the modality of the data in specific \napplications. \nThe most common data modalities in the AML literature include: \n• Image: Adversarial examples of image data [144, 362] have the advantage of a con-\ntinuous domain, and gradient-based methods can be applied directly for optimiza-\ntion. Backdoor poisoning attacks were first invented for images [148], and many \nprivacy attacks are run on image datasets (e.g., [342]).']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

In this game, Dill often plays the villainous character of Boo, while Jem takes on the role of a hero. Scout is usually assigned various lady characters. The plot and dialogue of the game are constantly changing, with each day bringing new additions to their small play. Despite Jem's assurances that Boo Radley is dead, there remains an underlying anxiety among the children due to local rumors about the Radleys and their reclusive lifestyle.                                                                                                                                                    | ['and sweep the porch. Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up and down the \nsidewalk and coughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally, was Boo: he went \nunder the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time.\nAs the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected it, added \ndialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang \nchanges every day.\nDill was a villain’s villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and \nappear tall if height was part of the devilry required. He was as good as his worst \nperformance; his worst performance was Gothic. I reluctantly played assorted \nladies who entered the script. I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I \nplayed that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jem’s assurances that \nBoo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in \nthe daytime and Atticus home at night.\nJem was a born hero.\nIt was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and \nneighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr. \nRadley and lost all her money. She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her \nright forefinger (Dill’s contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldn’t find \nany cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the \ntime, while Boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house.\nThe three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for a \nchange; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with \nthe brushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff, \nassorted townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the \nRadleys than anybody in Maycomb.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The game is a 'melancholy little drama' based on neighborhood gossip.

| Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23.                                                      | In Chapter 23, both Jem and Scout discuss their understanding of the differences among people. Initially, Jem suggests there are four kinds of folks: ordinary people like themselves and their neighbors, the Cunninghams who live in the woods, the Ewells who live near the dump, and African Americans. However, Jem later refines his view and states that what makes 'folks' different is not just the categories he previously mentioned but rather their level of literacy or education. In contrast to this, Scout questions the categorization itself and suggests that everyone's family background, including that of Englishmen and African Americans, is just as old as everybody else's.                                                                                                                                                   | ['Jem.”\n“Well then, how do you explain why the Cunninghams are different? Mr. Walter \ncan hardly sign his name, I’ve seen him. We’ve just been readin‘ and writin’ \nlonger’n they have.”\n“No, everybody’s gotta learn, nobody’s born knowin‘. That Walter’s as smart as \nhe can be, he just gets held back sometimes because he has to stay out and help \nhis daddy. Nothin’s wrong with him. Naw, Jem, I think there’s just one kind of \nfolks. Folks.”\nJem turned around and punched his pillow. When he settled back his face was \ncloudy. He was going into one of his declines, and I grew wary. His brows came \ntogether; his mouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while.\n“That’s what I thought, too,” he said at last, “when I was your age. If there’s just \none kind of folks, why can’t they get along with each other? If they’re all alike, \nwhy do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I’m \nbeginning to understand something. I think I’m beginning to understand why Boo \nRadley’s stayed shut up in the house all this time… it’s because he wants to stay \ninside.”\nContents - Prev / Next\nChapter 24\nCalpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron.

He ain’t like the Ewells.”\nJem kicked off his shoes and swung his feet to the bed. He propped himself \nagainst a pillow and switched on the reading light. “You know something, Scout? \nI’ve got it all figured out, now. I’ve thought about it a lot lately and I’ve got it \nfigured out. There’s four kinds of folks in the world. There’s the ordinary kind \nlike us and the neighbors, there’s the kind like the Cunninghams out in the woods, \nthe kind like the Ewells down at the dump, and the Negroes.”\n“What about the Chinese, and the Cajuns down yonder in Baldwin County?”\n“I mean in Maycomb County. The thing about it is, our kind of folks don’t like \nthe Cunninghams, the Cunninghams don’t like the Ewells, and the Ewells hate \nand despise the colored folks.”\nI told Jem if that was so, then why didn’t Tom’s jury, made up of folks like the \nCunninghams, acquit Tom to spite the Ewells?“\nJem waved my question away as being infantile.\n“You know,” he said, “I’ve seen Atticus pat his foot when there’s fiddlin‘ on the \nradio, and he loves pot liquor better’n any man I ever saw—”\n“Then that makes us like the Cunninghams,” I said. “I can’t see why Aunty—”\n“No, lemme finish—it does, but we’re still different somehow. Atticus said one \ntime the reason Aunty’s so hipped on the family is because all we’ve got’s \nbackground and not a dime to our names.”\n“Well Jem, I don’t know—Atticus told me one time that most of this Old Family \nstuff’s foolishness because everybody’s family’s just as old as everybody else’s. I \nsaid did that include the colored folks and Englishmen and he said yes.”\n“Background doesn’t mean Old Family,” said Jem. “I think it’s how long your \nfamily’s been readin‘ and writin’.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | In the given text, Aunt Alexandra doesn't explicitly define "fine folks". However, she suggests that these individuals are good people but not part of their social group. On the other hand, Scout seems to understand 'good folks' as individuals who are kind and considerate, without any distinction based on social standing or affiliation. This contrasts with Aunt Alexandra's perspective where being 'fine folks' appears to be associated with a shared social identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ['“Why not, Aunty? \nThey’re good folks.”\nShe looked at me over her sewing glasses. “Jean Louise, there is no doubt in my \nmind that they’re good folks.

[61] demonstrated that such \ninformation could be extracted from black-box production LLMs, deriving previously un-\nknown hidden dimensions and the embedding projection layer (up to symmetries). \n47'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | The embedding model to be used is bge-m3:567m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     nan        |           0        |            0        |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

This report is not intended to provide \nan exhaustive survey of all available literature on Adversarial ML, which includes \nmore than 11,354 references on arXiv.org since 2021 as of July 2024. \nThis report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems. Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques. The intent is to raise awareness of open questions in the \nfield of AML and to call attention to trends that may shape risk and risk management \npractices in future. \n3']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

| According to the NIST document, what are some examples of privacy compromise attacks in predictive AI systems?                                                                          | In the provided NIST document, examples of privacy compromise attacks in predictive AI systems include DATA PRIVACY ATTACKS and MODEL PRIVACY ATTACKS. Data privacy attacks aim to learn information about the training data, while model privacy attacks aim to extract information about the model's parameters or architecture. Additionally, the document mentions DATA RECONSTRUCTION as an example of a specific objective within data privacy attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nwhich is added to both the poisoned samples and the testing samples to cause misclassi-\nfication. Backdoor attacks are the only attacks in the literature that require both training \nand testing data control. Model poisoning attacks could result in either targeted or back-\ndoor attacks, and the attacker modifies model parameters to cause an integrity violation. \nThey have been designed for centralized learning [222] and federated learning [22, 36]. \nPrivacy compromise [NISTAML.03] [Back to Index]. A PRIVACY COMPROMISE attack causes \nthe unintended leakage of restricted or proprietary information from a PredAI system, in-\ncluding details about a model’s training data, weights, or architecture [100, 309]. While \nthe term “confidentiality” is more widely used in taxonomies of traditional cybersecurity \nattacks, the AML field has tended to use the top-level term “privacy” to encompass both \nattacks against the confidentiality of a model (e.g., those that extract information about a \nmodel’s weights or architecture) and those that cause violations of expected privacy prop-\nerties of model outputs (e.g. by exposing model training data) [310]. DATA CONFIDENTIAL-\nITY during ML training can be achieved through secure computation methods based on \ncryptographic techniques [2, 253, 288, 385], which ensure that training data and model \nparameters remain protected during the training phase. However, even models trained \nusing paradigms that enforce data confidentiality may be vulnerable to privacy attacks, in \nwhich adversaries interacting with a model can extract information about its training data \nor parameters. In this report, we focus on privacy compromises that can occur at deploy-\nment time, regardless of the training method used, or whether data confidentiality was \nmaintained during training. \nIn privacy attacks, attackers might be interested in learning information about the training \ndata (resulting in DATA PRIVACY ATTACKS) or the ML model (resulting in MODEL PRIVACY AT-\nTACKS).

In GenAI moreso than in PredAI, different activities such as data col-\nlection, model training, model deployment, and application development are often carried \nout by multiple different organizations or actors. \nFor example, a common paradigm in GenAI is the use of a smaller number of foundation \nmodels to support a diverse range of downstream applications. Foundation models are \npre-trained on large-scale data using self-supervised learning in order to encode general \npatterns in text, images, or other data that may be relevant for many different applica-\ntions [311]. Data at the scale used in foundation models is often collected from a variety \nof internet sources (which attackers can target, such as in DATA POISONING attacks). \nThis generalist learning paradigm equips foundation models with a variety of capabilities \nand tendencies — many of which are desirable, but some of which may be harmful or \nunwanted by the model developer . Techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and \nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can be used after initial pre-training \nto better align the base model with human preferences and to curb undesirable or harmful \nmodel outputs [281] (see Fig. 3).

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age.

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022. The goal of this new framework was to provide a more flexible \nbut continued focus on annual assessments for the federal community.

IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022. The goal of this new framework was to provide a more flexible \nbut continued focus on annual assessments for the federal community.  This effort yielded two \ndistinct groups of metrics: Core and Supplemental. \n \nCo\nre Metrics  \nThere are 20 core metrics.

As a general best practice, broad recommendations should be \navoided.  Recommendations should be focused on specific actions to address the root cause and \nlead the agency to that next maturity level.  It may require several recommendations to get that \nmetric to the next level, however this provides the agency with specific guidance and the \nopportunity to make steady and visible progress.  This approach would also allow the assessors \nto follow-up on agency actions taken as part of their recommendation follow-up processes and/or \nthe next FISMA evaluation.  It is a matter of opinion, however generally a higher quantity of \nspecific recommendations is preferable over fewer broad recommendations.  \n \nH\now should agencies consider plans of action and milestone (POA&M)? \nAs part of the data collection process, it is recommended that assessors collect and consider open \nPOA&Ms that the organization has self-identified (or other means, such as past GAO or OIG \nreports, or assessment and authorization reviews) as issues they are working to resolve.  As a \nbest practice, assessors should avoid issuing recommendations that the organization is aware of \nand actively working to resolve.  To re-emphasize the open POA&M assessors should consider \nreferencing them in the narrative write up.  Another potential approach would be to issue an \n“Opportunity for Improvement” (OFI) or an “Item for Management’s Consideration” (IMC) to \nstate that the organization should prioritize the POA&M in order to continue to mature the \nmetric, domain, or program.

Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022.

The taxonomy is arranged in a \nconceptual hierarchy that includes key types of ML methods, life cycle stages of attack, and attacker \ngoals, objectives, capabilities, and knowledge. This report also identifies current challenges in the life \ncycle of AI systems and describes corresponding methods for mitigating and managing the \nconsequences of those attacks. The terminology used in this report is consistent with the literature on \nAML and is complemented by a glossary of key terms associated with the security of AI systems.

These challenges span different phases of ML operations such \nas the potential for adversarial manipulation of training data; the provision of adversar-\nial inputs to adversely affect the performance of the AI system; and even malicious ma-\nnipulations, modifications, or interactions with models to exfiltrate sensitive information \nfrom the model’s training data or to which the model has access. Such attacks have been \ndemonstrated under real-world conditions, and their sophistication and impacts have been \nincreasing steadily. \nThe field of AML is concerned with studying these attacks. It must consider the capabilities \nof attackers, the model or system properties that attackers might seek to violate in pursuit \nof their objectives, and the design of attack methods that exploit vulnerabilities during the \ndevelopment, training, and deployment phases of the ML life cycle. It is also concerned \nwith the design of ML algorithms and systems that can withstand these security and privacy \nchallenges, a property often known as robustness [274]. \nTo taxonimize these attacks, this report differentiates between predictive and generative \nAI systems and the attacks relevant to each. It considers the components of an AI system \nincluding the data; the model itself; the processes for training, testing, and deploying the \nmodel; and the broader software and system contexts into which models may be embed-\nded, such as cases where Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models are deployed \nwith access to private data or equipped with tools to take actions with real-world conse-\nquences. \nThus, the attacks within this taxonomy are classified relative to: (i) the AI system type, (ii) \nthe stage of the ML life cycle process in which the attack is mounted, (iii) the attacker’s \ngoals and objectives in terms']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

This could potentially lead to undesirable outcomes such as generating harmful content or bypassing safety mechanisms. The Crescendo attack is an example of an adaptive multi-turn attack that achieves this through iterative interaction with the model using seemingly harmless prompts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ['is harmful, it may be used as a reward function to \ntrain a generative model to generate jailbreaks of another generative model. Only \nquery access is required for each of the models, and no human intervention is re-\nquired to update or refine a candidate jailbreak. The prompts may also be transfer-\nable from the target model to other closed-source LLMs [73]. \nThe Crescendo attack [316] introduced the idea of interacting with the model itera-\ntively in a multi-turn adaptive attack that includes seemingly benign prompts, even-\ntually leading to a successful jailbreak against safety alignment. The initial manual \nattack is fully automated by leveraging another LLM for prompt generation and in-\ncorporating multiple input sources. \n45'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | A jailbreak is a direct prompting attack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as bypassing refusal behavior to enable misuse.                                                                                                                                                                                               |       1        |           0.9876   |            1        |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

This report is not intended to provide \nan exhaustive survey of all available literature on Adversarial ML, which includes \nmore than 11,354 references on arXiv.org since 2021 as of July 2024. \nThis report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems. Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques. The intent is to raise awareness of open questions in the \nfield of AML and to call attention to trends that may shape risk and risk management \npractices in future. \n3'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The three main classes of defenses against evasion attacks are adversarial training, randomized smoothing, and formal verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       1        |           0        |            1        |         0.5      | token_text_splitter |

These are demonstrations of evasion vulnerabilities by researchers, \nbut did not result in attacks in the wild. \n2.2.5. Mitigations \nMitig\nating evasion attacks is challenging because adversarial examples are widespread in \na variety of ML model architectures and application domains. Possible explanations for \nthe existence of adversarial examples are that ML models rely on non-robust features that \nare not aligned with human perception in the computer vision domain [174]. In the last \nfew years, many of the proposed mitigations against adversarial examples have been in-\neffective against stronger attacks. Furthermore, several papers have performed extensive \nevaluations and defeated a large number of proposed mitigations: \n• Carlini and Wagner showed how to bypass 10 methods for detecting adversarial ex-\namples and described several guidelines for evaluating defenses [64]. Recent work \nshows that detecting adversarial examples is as difficult as building a defense [373]. \nTherefore, this direction for mitigating adversarial examples is similarly challenging \nas designing defenses. \n• The Obfuscated Gradients attack [20] was specifically designed to defeat several pro-\nposed defenses that rely on masking gradients to protect against optimization-based \nattacks. It relies on a new technique, Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation, \nwhich approximates the gradient during the backward pass of backpropagation, and \nwas shown to bypass several proposed defenses based on gradient masking. \n• Tramèr et al. [375] described a methodology for designing adaptive attacks against \nproposed defenses and circumvented 13 existing defenses. They advocate for de-\nsigning adaptive attacks to test newly proposed defenses rather than merely testing \nthe defenses against well-known attacks. \nFrom the wide range of proposed defenses against adversarial evasion attacks, three main \nclasses have proven to be resilient and have the potential to provide mitigation against \nevasion attacks: \n1. Adversarial training: Introduced by Goodfellow et al. [144] and further developed \nby Madry et al. [232], adversarial training is a general method that augments train-\ning data with adversarial examples generated iteratively during training using their \ncorrect labels.

| What is the objective of the experiment detailed in the '2025-06-25_Test_Notes.pdf'?                                                                                                    | The objective of the experiment as detailed in '2025-06-25_Test_Notes.pdf' appears to be evaluating and comparing different chunking strategies by keeping constant factors such as Data, Embedding Model, Vector Database, Language Model, Query Set, and Chunking Parameters (except for the size and overlap of chunks). The primary dependent variables being measured are Chunk count, ingestion/retrieval time, and answer quality scores.

He said Atticus never talked \nmuch about the Radleys: when Jem would question him Atticus’s only answer \nwas for him to mind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a \nright to; but when it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said, “Mm, \nmm, mm.”\nSo Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford, a \nneighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing. According to Miss \nStephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from The \nMaycomb Tribune to paste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr. \nRadley passed by, Boo drove the scissors into his parent’s leg, pulled them out, \nwiped them on his pants, and resumed his activities.\nMrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but \nwhen the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the \nTribune. He was thirty-three years old then.\nMiss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum, \nwhen it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo \nwasn’t crazy, he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr. \nRadley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not \na criminal. The sheriff hadn’t the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so \nBoo was locked in the courthouse basement.\nBoo’s transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jem’s memory. \nMiss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he \ndidn’t take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could \nnot live forever on the bounty of the county.\nNobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep Boo out of \nsight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained to the'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Arthur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     nan        |           0        |            1        |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

He was a thin leathery man with \ncolorless eyes, so colorless they did not reflect light. His cheekbones were sharp \nand his mouth was wide, with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip. Miss Stephanie \nCrawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as his only law, and we \nbelieved her, because Mr. Radley’s posture was ramrod straight.\nHe never spoke to us. When he passed we would look at the ground and say, \n“Good morning, sir,” and he would cough in reply. Mr. Radley’s elder son lived \nin Pensacola; he came home at Christmas, and he was one of the few persons we \never saw enter or leave the place. From the day Mr. Radley took Arthur home, \npeople said the house died.\nBut there came a day when Atticus told us he’d wear us out if we made any noise \nin the yard and commissioned Calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a \nsound out of us. Mr. Radley was dying.\nHe took his time about it. Wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the \nRadley lot, straw was put down on the sidewalk, traffic was diverted to the back \nstreet. Dr. Reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the \nRadley’s every time he called. Jem and I crept around the yard for days. At last \nthe sawhorses were taken away, and we stood watching from the front porch \nwhen Mr. Radley made his final journey past our house.\n“There goes the meanest man ever God blew breath into,” murmured Calpurnia, \nand she spat meditatively into the yard. We looked at her in surprise, for \nCalpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people.\nThe neighborhood thought when Mr. Radley went under Boo would come out, \nbut it had another think coming: Boo’s elder brother returned from Pensacola and \ntook Mr. Radley’s place. The only difference between him and his father was \ntheir ages. Jem said Mr. Nathan Radley “bought cotton,” too.

I followed him. “Hasn’t passed by yet,” he said.\nNext day Jem repeated his vigil and was rewarded.\n“Hidy do, Mr. Nathan,” he said.\n“Morning Jem, Scout,” said Mr. Radley, as he went by.\n“Mr. Radley,” said Jem.\nMr. Radley turned around.\n“Mr. Radley, ah—did you put cement in that hole in that tree down yonder?”\n“Yes,” he said. “I filled it up.”\n“Why’d you do it, sir?”\n“Tree’s dying. You plug ‘em with cement when they’re sick. You ought to know \nthat, Jem.”\nJem said nothing more about it until late afternoon. When we passed our tree he \ngave it a meditative pat on its cement, and remained deep in thought. He seemed \nto be working himself into a bad humor, so I kept my distance.\nAs usual, we met Atticus coming home from work that evening. When we were at \nour steps Jem said, “Atticus, look down yonder at that tree, please sir.”\n“What tree, son?”\n“The one on the corner of the Radley lot comin‘ from school.”\n“Yes?”\n“Is that tree dyin‘?”\n“Why no, son, I don’t think so. Look at the leaves, they’re all green and full, no \nbrown patches anywhere—”\n“It ain’t even sick?”\n“That tree’s as healthy as you are, Jem. Why?”\n“Mr. Nathan Radley said it was dyin‘.”\n“Well maybe it is. I’m sure Mr. Radley knows more about his trees than we do.”\nAtticus left us on the porch.

When we went home, Jem put the dolls in his trunk.\nLess than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum, which we \nenjoyed, the fact that everything on the Radley Place was poison having slipped \nJem’s memory.\nThe following week the knot-hole yielded a tarnished medal. Jem showed it to \nAtticus, who said it was a spelling medal, that before we were born the Maycomb \nCounty schools had spelling contests and awarded medals to the winners. Atticus \nsaid someone must have lost it, and had we asked around? Jem camel-kicked me \nwhen I tried to say where we had found it. Jem asked Atticus if he remembered \nanybody who ever won one, and Atticus said no.\nOur biggest prize appeared four days later. It was a pocket watch that wouldn’t \nrun, on a chain with an aluminum knife.\n“You reckon it’s white gold, Jem?”\n“Don’t know. I’ll show it to Atticus.”\nAtticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars, knife, chain and all, if it were \nnew. “Did you swap with somebody at school?” he asked.\n“Oh, no sir!” Jem pulled out his grandfather’s watch that Atticus let him carry \nonce a week if Jem were careful with it. On the days he carried the watch, Jem \nwalked on eggs. “Atticus, if it’s all right with you, I’d rather have this one instead. \nMaybe I can fix it.”\nWhen the new wore off his grandfather’s watch, and carrying it became a day’s \nburdensome task, Jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every \nfive minutes.\nHe did a fair job, only one spring and two tiny pieces left over, but the watch \nwould not run. “Oh-h,” he sighed, “it’ll never go. Scout—?”\n“Huh?”\n“You reckon we oughta write a letter to whoever’s leaving us these things?”\n“That’d be right nice, Jem, we can thank ‘em—what’s wrong?”\nJem was holding his']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age.

Jem said it might work if I \ncried and flung a fit, being young and a girl. That didn’t work either. But when he \nnoticed us dragging around the neighborhood, not eating, taking little interest in \nour normal pursuits, Atticus discovered how deeply frightened we were. He \ntempted Jem with a new football magazine one night; when he saw Jem flip the \npages and toss it aside, he said, “What’s bothering you, son?”\nJem came to the point: “Mr. Ewell.”\n“What has happened?”\n“Nothing’s happened. We’re scared for you, and we think you oughta do \nsomething about him.”\nAtticus smiled wryly. “Do what? Put him under a peace bond?”\n“When a man says he’s gonna get you, looks like he means it.”\n“He meant it when he said it,” said Atticus. “Jem, see if you can stand in Bob \nEwell’s shoes a minute. I destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he \nhad any to begin with. The man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind \nalways does. So if spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewell \none extra beating, that’s something I’ll gladly take. He had to take it out on \nsomebody and I’d rather it be me than that houseful of children out there. You \nunderstand?”\nJem nodded.\nAunt Alexandra entered the room as Atticus was saying, “We don’t have anything \nto fear from Bob Ewell, he got it all out of his system that morning.”\n“I wouldn’t be so sure of that, Atticus,” she said. “His kind’d do anything to pay \noff a grudge.

| Describe the 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level for the metric regarding an organization's inventory of information systems.                                                     | The 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level refers to a stage where the procedures or practices associated with an organization's inventory of information systems are regularly executed without significant variation. This means that the implementation of these procedures is consistent and predictable, indicating a robust system in place. However, it does not necessarily imply optimization or continuous improvement in this area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ['24 \n \nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL \n \nAssessor Best Practices \n \nDefined:   \n \nConsistently Implemented:   \n \nManaged and measurable:   \n \nOptimized:   \n \n6.

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | In the provided document, a black-box attack is described as an attack where the adversary operates with minimal to no knowledge about the Machine Learning (ML) system. The adversary may only have query access to the model but lacks any information regarding how the model was trained or any other details. On the other hand, a white-box attack assumes that the attacker has complete knowledge of the ML system, including its architecture, parameters, and training data. This means that in a black-box attack, the attacker is assumed to have no or limited knowledge about the AI system, whereas in a white-box attack, the attacker possesses extensive information about the system.                                                                                                                                                  | ['How to Read This Document \nThis document uses the terms “AI technology,” “AI system,” and “AI applications” inter-\nchangeably.

This definition is more general and encompasses the no-\ntion of adaptive attacks in which knowledge of the mitigations applied to the model or the \nsystem is explicitly tracked. \nBlack-box attacks. These attacks assume that the attacker operates with minimal, and \nsometimes no knowledge at all about the ML system. An adversary might have query \naccess to the model, but they have no other information about how the model is trained. \nThese attacks are the most practical since they assume that the attacker has no knowledge \nof the AI system and utilizes system interfaces readily available for normal use. \nGray-box attacks. There are a range of gray-box attacks that capture adversarial knowl-\nedge between black-box and white-box attacks. Suciu et al. [358] introduced a framework \nto classify gray-box attacks. An attacker might know the model architecture but not its pa-\nrameters, or the attacker might know the model and its parameters but not the training \ndata. Other common assumptions for gray-box attacks are that the attacker has access to \ndata distributed identically to the training data and knows the feature representation. The \nlatter assumption is important for applications in which feature extraction is used before \ntraining an ML model, such as cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. \n2.1.5. Data Mo dality \nUntil r\necently, most attacks and defenses in adversarial machine learning have operated \nunder a single modality, but a new trend in the field is to use multimodal data. The tax-\nonomy of attacks defined in Fig. 1 is independent of the modality of the data in specific \napplications. \nThe most common data modalities in the AML literature include: \n• Image: Adversarial examples of image data [144, 362] have the advantage of a con-\ntinuous domain, and gradient-based methods can be applied directly for optimiza-\ntion. Backdoor poisoning attacks were first invented for images [148], and many \nprivacy attacks are run on image datasets (e.g., [342]). The image modality includes \nother types of imaging (e.g., LIDAR, SAR, IR, hyperspectral). \n• Text: Text is']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Jem takes on the role of a hero, while Dill plays various villainous characters. Scout initially acts as an assorted lady in the script but later takes on the role of Mrs. Radley when the game progresses. The play involves various scenes and characters, including Jem sneaking into the Radley house, stealing scissors from the sewing-machine drawer, and sitting in the swing. The game is a daily ritual for them during summer, with each day bringing changes to the script.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ['and sweep the porch. Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up and down the \nsidewalk and coughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally, was Boo: he went \nunder the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time.\nAs the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected it, added \ndialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang \nchanges every day.\nDill was a villain’s villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and \nappear tall if height was part of the devilry required. He was as good as his worst \nperformance; his worst performance was Gothic. I reluctantly played assorted \nladies who entered the script. I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I \nplayed that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jem’s assurances that \nBoo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in \nthe daytime and Atticus home at night.\nJem was a born hero.\nIt was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and \nneighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr. \nRadley and lost all her money. She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her \nright forefinger (Dill’s contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldn’t find \nany cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the \ntime, while Boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house.\nThe three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for a \nchange; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with \nthe brushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff, \nassorted townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the \nRadleys than anybody in Maycomb.\nWhen it was time to play Boo’s big scene, Jem would sneak into the house, steal \nthe scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when Calpurnia’s back was turned, \nthen sit in the swing and'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The game is a 'melancholy little drama' based on neighborhood gossip.

Lemonade would restore his good humor.\nJem gulped down his second glassful and slapped his chest. “I know what we are \ngoing to play,” he announced. “Something new, something different.”\n“What?” asked Dill.\n“Boo Radley.”\nJem’s head at times was transparent: he had thought that up to make me \nunderstand he wasn’t afraid of Radleys in any shape or form, to contrast his own \nfearless heroism with my cowardice.\n“Boo Radley? How?” asked Dill.\nJem said, “Scout, you can be Mrs. Radley-”\n“I declare if I will. I don’t think-”\n“‘Smatter?” said Dill. “Still scared?”\n“He can get out at night when we’re all asleep…” I said.\nJem hissed. “Scout, how’s he gonna know what we’re doin‘? Besides, I don’t \nthink he’s still there. He died years ago and they stuffed him up the chimney.”\nDill said, “Jem, you and me can play and Scout can watch if she’s scared.”\nI was fairly sure Boo Radley was inside that house, but I couldn’t prove it, and \nfelt it best to keep my mouth shut or I would be accused of believing in Hot \nSteams, phenomena I was immune to in the daytime.\nJem']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23.                                                      | In Chapter 23, both Jem and Scout question why certain groups of people cannot get along with each other if they are all the same kind. However, their perspectives differ slightly on what makes 'folks' different from one another. While Scout has a more simplistic view that people are divided based on external characteristics like race or social status, Jem begins to form a more nuanced understanding. He suggests that it might be due to personal choices and individual preferences, as indicated by his statement about Boo Radley choosing to stay inside. This shift in Jem's thinking reflects his growing maturity and awareness of societal complexities.                                                                                                                                                                           | ['Jem.”\n“Well then, how do you explain why the Cunninghams are different? Mr. Walter \ncan hardly sign his name, I’ve seen him. We’ve just been readin‘ and writin’ \nlonger’n they have.”\n“No, everybody’s gotta learn, nobody’s born knowin‘. That Walter’s as smart as \nhe can be, he just gets held back sometimes because he has to stay out and help \nhis daddy. Nothin’s wrong with him. Naw, Jem, I think there’s just one kind of \nfolks. Folks.”\nJem turned around and punched his pillow. When he settled back his face was \ncloudy. He was going into one of his declines, and I grew wary. His brows came \ntogether; his mouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while.\n“That’s what I thought, too,” he said at last, “when I was your age. If there’s just \none kind of folks, why can’t they get along with each other? If they’re all alike, \nwhy do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I’m \nbeginning to understand something. I think I’m beginning to understand why Boo \nRadley’s stayed shut up in the house all this time… it’s because he wants to stay \ninside.”\nContents - Prev / Next\nChapter 24\nCalpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron.

These attacks aim to either reverse-engineer private information about an individual user record or sensitive input data (Data Reconstruction), determine whether a particular record was included in the dataset used for training an ML model (Membership-Inference), extract global information about a training dataset (Property Inference), or extract information about an ML model such as its architecture or parameters (Model Extraction).                                                                                                                                 | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nwhich is added to both the poisoned samples and the testing samples to cause misclassi-\nfication. Backdoor attacks are the only attacks in the literature that require both training \nand testing data control. Model poisoning attacks could result in either targeted or back-\ndoor attacks, and the attacker modifies model parameters to cause an integrity violation. \nThey have been designed for centralized learning [222] and federated learning [22, 36]. \nPrivacy compromise [NISTAML.03] [Back to Index]. A PRIVACY COMPROMISE attack causes \nthe unintended leakage of restricted or proprietary information from a PredAI system, in-\ncluding details about a model’s training data, weights, or architecture [100, 309]. While \nthe term “confidentiality” is more widely used in taxonomies of traditional cybersecurity \nattacks, the AML field has tended to use the top-level term “privacy” to encompass both \nattacks against the confidentiality of a model (e.g., those that extract information about a \nmodel’s weights or architecture) and those that cause violations of expected privacy prop-\nerties of model outputs (e.g. by exposing model training data) [310]. DATA CONFIDENTIAL-\nITY during ML training can be achieved through secure computation methods based on \ncryptographic techniques [2, 253, 288, 385], which ensure that training data and model \nparameters remain protected during the training phase. However, even models trained \nusing paradigms that enforce data confidentiality may be vulnerable to privacy attacks, in \nwhich adversaries interacting with a model can extract information about its training data \nor parameters. In this report, we focus on privacy compromises that can occur at deploy-\nment time, regardless of the training method used, or whether data confidentiality was \nmaintained during training. \nIn privacy attacks, attackers might be interested in learning information about the training \ndata (resulting in DATA PRIVACY ATTACKS) or the ML model (resulting in MODEL PRIVACY AT-\nTACKS). The attacker could have different objectives for compromising the privacy of train-\ning data, such as DATA RECONSTRUCTION [110] (inferring the content or features of train-\ning data), MEMBERSHIP-INFERENCE ATTACK [162, 343] (inferring the presence of data in the \ntraining set), TRAINING DATA EXTRACTION [59, 63] (extracting training data from generative \nmodels), ATTRIBUTE INFERENCE ATTACKS [184, 409] (inferring sensitive attributes of training \nrecords) and PROPERTY INFERENCE [134] (inferring properties about the training data dis-\ntribution).

Privacy Attacks and Mitigations \n[NISTAML.03] [Back to Index] \nThe seminal work of Dinur and Nissim [110] introduced DATA RECONSTRUCTION attacks, \nwhich seek to reverse-engineer private information about an individual user record or \nother sensitive input data from access to a trained model. More recently, data recon-\nstruction attacks have been designed for binary and multi-class neural network classi-\nfiers [50, 152]. With MEMBERSHIP-INFERENCE ATTACK, an adversary can determine whether \na particular record was included in the dataset used for training an ML model. Mem-\nbership inference attacks were first introduced by Homer et al. [162] for genomic data. \nRecent literature focuses on membership attacks against ML models in mostly black-box \nsettings in which adversaries have query access to a trained ML model [54, 342, 422]. Prop-\nerty inference attacks [19, 74, 134, 233, 361, 437] aim to extract global information about \na training dataset, such as the fraction of training examples with a certain sensitive at-\ntribute. A different privacy violation for MLaaS is MODEL EXTRACTION attacks, which are \ndesigned to extract information about an ML model, such as its architecture or model pa-\nrameters3 \n3A privacy violation in this context describes a loss of confidential information about an ML model. If ML \nmodel leakage leads to further privacy violations for individuals (e.g., identity theft, sensitive data extrac-\ntion), it may also be viewed as a cybersecurity-related privacy event.

In GenAI moreso than in PredAI, different activities such as data col-\nlection, model training, model deployment, and application development are often carried \nout by multiple different organizations or actors. \nFor example, a common paradigm in GenAI is the use of a smaller number of foundation \nmodels to support a diverse range of downstream applications. Foundation models are \npre-trained on large-scale data using self-supervised learning in order to encode general \npatterns in text, images, or other data that may be relevant for many different applica-\ntions [311]. Data at the scale used in foundation models is often collected from a variety \nof internet sources (which attackers can target, such as in DATA POISONING attacks). \nThis generalist learning paradigm equips foundation models with a variety of capabilities \nand tendencies — many of which are desirable, but some of which may be harmful or \nunwanted by the model developer . Techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and \nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can be used after initial pre-training \nto better align the base model with human preferences and to curb undesirable or harmful \nmodel outputs [281] (see Fig. 3). However, these interventions can later be targeted using \nAML techniques by attackers seeking to recover or re-enable potentially harmful capabili-\nties. \nDevelopers can make trained foundation models available to downstream users and de-\nvelopers in a variety of ways, including openly releasing the model’s weights for re-use and \n36 ']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here.

Calpurnia set a pitcher and three glasses on the porch, then \nwent about her business. Being out of Jem’s good graces did not worry me \nespecially.

IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022. The goal of this new framework was to provide a more flexible \nbut continued focus on annual assessments for the federal community.

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

Further, IGs should explain in CyberScope the impact this has on the IGs \nability to determine the effectiveness of their agency’s information security program.  \n \nTh\ne tables below show the IG metrics for FY25 IG evaluation period. \n ']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022. The goal of this new framework was to provide a more flexible \nbut continued focus on annual assessments for the federal community.

The taxonomy is arranged in a \nconceptual hierarchy that includes key types of ML methods, life cycle stages of attack, and attacker \ngoals, objectives, capabilities, and knowledge. This report also identifies current challenges in the life \ncycle of AI systems and describes corresponding methods for mitigating and managing the \nconsequences of those attacks. The terminology used in this report is consistent with the literature on \nAML and is complemented by a glossary of key terms associated with the security of AI systems. Taken \ntogether, the taxonomy and terminology are meant to inform other standards and future practice guides \nfor assessing and managing the security of AI systems by establishing a common language for the \nrapidly developing AML landscape. \nKeywords \nartificial intelligence; machine learning; attack taxonomy; abuse; data poisoning; evasion; privacy \nbreach; attack mitigation; large language model; chatbot. \n'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The report distinguishes between two broad classes of AI systems: predictive AI (PredAI) and generative AI (GenAI).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     nan        |           0.997336 |            0.5      |       nan        | semantic_splitter   |

These challenges span different phases of ML operations such \nas the potential for adversarial manipulation of training data; the provision of adversar-\nial inputs to adversely affect the performance of the AI system; and even malicious ma-\nnipulations, modifications, or interactions with models to exfiltrate sensitive information \nfrom the model’s training data or to which the model has access. Such attacks have been \ndemonstrated under real-world conditions, and their sophistication and impacts have been \nincreasing steadily. \nThe field of AML is concerned with studying these attacks. It must consider the capabilities \nof attackers, the model or system properties that attackers might seek to violate in pursuit \nof their objectives, and the design of attack methods that exploit vulnerabilities during the \ndevelopment, training, and deployment phases of the ML life cycle. It is also concerned \nwith the design of ML algorithms and systems that can withstand these security and privacy \nchallenges, a property often known as robustness [274]. \nTo taxonimize these attacks, this report differentiates between predictive and generative \nAI systems and the attacks relevant to each. It considers the components of an AI system \nincluding the data; the model itself; the processes for training, testing, and deploying the \nmodel; and the broader software and system contexts into which models may be embed-\nded, such as cases where Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models are deployed \nwith access to private data or equipped with tools to take actions with real-world conse-\nquences. \nThus, the attacks within this taxonomy are classified relative to: (i) the AI system type, (ii) \nthe stage of the ML life cycle process in which the attack is mounted, (iii) the attacker’s \ngoals and objectives in terms of the system properties they seek to violate, (iv) the at-\ntacker’s capabilities and access, and (v) the attacker’s knowledge of the learning process \nand beyond. \nThis report adopts the concepts of security, resilience, and robustness of ML systems from \nthe NIST AI Risk Management Framework. Security, resilience, and robustness are gauged \nby risk, which is a measure of the extent to which an entity (e.g., a system) is threatened by \na potential circumstance or event (e.g., an attack) and the severity of the outcome should \nsuch an event occur . However, this report does not make recommendations on risk toler-\nance (i.e., the level of risk that is acceptable to organizations or society) because it is highly \ncontextual and specific to applications and use cases. \n']                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| In the context of Generative AI, what is a 'jailbreak'?                                                                                                                                 | In the provided context, it appears that 'jailbreak' may refer to a type of attack or manipulation aimed at circumventing the intended control or restrictions of a generative AI model. However, this interpretation is based on inference from the terms "jailbreak-specific training approaches" and "inversion attacks on unlearning methods," which are mentioned in relation to reducing harms from maliciously directed models. Without direct reference to the term 'jailbreak', it cannot be definitively stated what a 'jailbreak' is within the provided context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ['There have also been attempts to “unlearn” harmful knowledge or ca-\npabilities post-training [212], with the goal of reducing harms from maliciously di-\nrected models [158]. However, these methods remain vulnerable to adversarial at-\ntacks, including attacks on jailbreak-specific training approaches [367] and inversion \nattacks on unlearning methods [328], which extract supposedly unlearned data. \n• Watermarking. Developers or deployers may watermark content generated by an \nAI model to help trace its provenance, distinguish it from human-generated con-\ntent, and reduce risks from malicious use cases (e.g., by flagging content as model-\ngenerated when it appears online). While the literature has proposed various tech-\nniques with different strengths and weaknesses [194], there is no watermarking \ntechnique that is universally effective and robust under all circumstances. Many \npowerful attacks have been developed against watermarking with high success rates [188, \n319]. Moreover, theoretical impossibility results regarding the robustness of water-\nmarking have also been established [432]. \nFinally, beyond interventions at the developer or deployer levels, society and infrastructure \ncan become more resilient to maliciously directed model capabilities over time [7, 33]. For \nexample, defenders could adopt AI-based vulnerability discovery tools [99] to make their \nsystems more resilient to malicious actors misusing GenAI models to find vulnerabilities \nfor exploitation. \n3.4. Indirect  Prompt Injection Attacks and Mitigations \n[NIS\nTAML.015] [Back to Index] Many use cases for GenAI models involve models interact-\ning with additional resources, from an internet-connected AGENT to a RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED \nGENERATION (RAG) system depicted in Fig. 6. Because GenAI models combine the data and \ninstruction channels, attackers can leverage the data channel to affect system operations by \nmanipulating resources with which the system interacts. Thus, INDIRECT PROMPT INJECTION \nattacks are enabled by RESOURCE CONTROL that allows an attacker to indirectly (or remotely) \ninject system prompts without directly interacting with the application [146, 408]. Indirect \nprompt injection attacks can result in violations across at least three categories of attacker \ngoals: 1) availability violation, 2) integrity violation, and 3) privacy compromise.

However, it mentions that the report identifies current challenges in the life cycle of AI systems and describes corresponding methods for mitigating and managing the consequences of those attacks. Therefore, one might infer that the report discusses defense strategies against adversarial evasion attacks, but more specific information is not provided within the given context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \n2.2. Evasion Attacks and Mitigations \n[NISTAML.022] [Back to Index] \nThe discovery of evasion attacks against ML models has led to significant growth in AML \nresearch over the last decade. In an evasion attack, the adversary’s goal is to generate \nadversarial examples: samples whose classification can be changed to an arbitrary class \nof the attacker’s choice – often with only minimal perturbation [362]. For example, in the \ncontext of image classification, the perturbation of the original sample might be small so \nthat a human cannot observe the transformation of the input; while the ML model can \nbe tricked to classify the adversarial example in the target class selected by the attacker, \nhumans still recognize it as part of the original class. \nEarly known instances of evasion attacks date back to 1988 with the work of Kearns and \nLi [192] and 2004 when Dalvi et al. [98] and Lowd and Meek [226] demonstrated the ex-\nistence of adversarial examples for linear classifiers used in spam filters. Later, Szedegy \net al. [362] showed that deep neural networks used for image classification could be eas-\nily manipulated through adversarial examples. In 2013, Szedegy et al.

The taxonomy is arranged in a \nconceptual hierarchy that includes key types of ML methods, life cycle stages of attack, and attacker \ngoals, objectives, capabilities, and knowledge. This report also identifies current challenges in the life \ncycle of AI systems and describes corresponding methods for mitigating and managing the \nconsequences of those attacks. The terminology used in this report is consistent with the literature on \nAML and is complemented by a glossary of key terms associated with the security of AI systems. Taken \ntogether, the taxonomy and terminology are meant to inform other standards and future practice guides \nfor assessing and managing the security of AI systems by establishing a common language for the \nrapidly developing AML landscape. \nKeywords \nartificial intelligence; machine learning; attack taxonomy; abuse; data poisoning; evasion; privacy \nbreach; attack mitigation; large language model; chatbot. \n']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Hot with embarrassment, I tried to cover up by \ncovering Jem up.\n“Ah-ah, don’t touch him,” Atticus said.\nMr. Heck Tate sat looking intently at Boo through his horn-rimmed glasses. He \nwas about to speak when Dr. Reynolds came down the hall.\n“Everybody out,” he said, as he came in the door. “Evenin‘, Arthur, didn’t notice \nyou the first time I was here.”\nDr. Reynolds’s voice was as breezy as his step, as though he had said it every \nevening of his life, an announcement that astounded me even more than being in \nthe same room with Boo Radley. Of course… even Boo Radley got sick \nsometimes, I thought.

When we were at \nour steps Jem said, “Atticus, look down yonder at that tree, please sir.”\n“What tree, son?”\n“The one on the corner of the Radley lot comin‘ from school.”\n“Yes?”\n“Is that tree dyin‘?”\n“Why no, son, I don’t think so. Look at the leaves, they’re all green and full, no \nbrown patches anywhere—”\n“It ain’t even sick?”\n“That tree’s as healthy as you are, Jem. Why?”\n“Mr. '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | They found chewing gum, two polished Indian-head pennies, a ball of gray twine, two soap dolls carved to look like them, a tarnished spelling medal, and a broken pocket watch with a chain and aluminum knife.                                                                                                                                          |       0.8      |           1        |            0.5      |         0.333333 | semantic_splitter   |

However, the first-person perspective and the use of "I" and "me" suggest that it might be a young character. Based on the dialogue between Atticus and the narrator (which appears to be a child), and the age of other characters mentioned such as Jem and Miss Maudie, it seems reasonable to infer that the narrator could potentially be Scout Finch, one of the children in the story. It's important to note that this is an inference based on the text provided, and the actual identity of the narrator may vary depending on different interpretations or editions of the novel.                                                                                                                                                                | [' \n \n1960\nTO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD\nby Harper Lee\nCopyright (C) 1960 by Harper Lee\nCopyright (C) renewed 1988 by Harper Lee\nPublished by arrangement with McIntosh and Otis, Inc. \n \nCONTENTS'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The story is narrated by Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       0.555556 |           0.970966 |            0.5      |       nan        | semantic_splitter   |

| Describe the 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level for the metric regarding an organization's inventory of information systems.                                                     | The 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level refers to the stage in which a process or program, such as an organization's inventory of information systems, is systematically applied on a regular basis without deviation from its established procedure. This indicates that the procedures and standards for managing the inventory are consistently followed, ensuring that the process functions effectively over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ['Taking into consideration the overall maturity level generated from the questions \nabove and based on all testing performed, is the contingency planning program effective? \nCriteria Review \nCycle Maturity Level Suggested Standard Source Evidence \n•  Annual Ad Hoc  \n \n Defined \n \n \n•  \n Consistently Implemented \n \n•  \n Managed and Measurable \n \n \n•  \n Optimized: •  \nAssessor Best Practices \nDefined:   \n \nConsistently Implemented:   \n \nManaged and measurable:   \n \nOptimized:    \n '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | At the 'Consistently Implemented' level, the organization consistently implements its policies, procedures, and processes to maintain a comprehensive and accurate inventory of its information systems, including cloud systems, public-facing websites, and third-party systems, and system interconnections.                                          |       0.833333 |           0.817509 |            1        |       nan        | semantic_splitter   |

This includes knowledge of the model architecture, its parameters, and potentially the training data. On the other hand, a black-box attack assumes that the attacker operates with minimal or no knowledge about the ML system. The adversary only has query access to the model, but no other information about how it's trained. In essence, a white-box attack leverages more detailed knowledge about the AI system than a black-box attack does.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nto evaluate potential mitigations. This definition is more general and encompasses the no-\ntion of adaptive attacks in which knowledge of the mitigations applied to the model or the \nsystem is explicitly tracked. \nBlack-box attacks. These attacks assume that the attacker operates with minimal, and \nsometimes no knowledge at all about the ML system. An adversary might have query \naccess to the model, but they have no other information about how the model is trained. \nThese attacks are the most practical since they assume that the attacker has no knowledge \nof the AI system and utilizes system interfaces readily available for normal use. \nGray-box attacks. There are a range of gray-box attacks that capture adversarial knowl-\nedge between black-box and white-box attacks. Suciu et al. [358] introduced a framework \nto classify gray-box attacks. An attacker might know the model architecture but not its pa-\nrameters, or the attacker might know the model and its parameters but not the training \ndata. Other common assumptions for gray-box attacks are that the attacker has access to \ndata distributed identically to the training data and knows the feature representation. The \nlatter assumption is important for applications in which feature extraction is used before \ntraining an ML model, such as cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. \n'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | A white-box attack assumes the attacker has full knowledge of the machine learning system, including training data and architecture.

In this story, they assign roles to themselves, with Dill portraying Old Mr. Radley, Jem enacting Boo Radley, and Scout taking on various female characters. The game involves Jem sneaking into the Radley house and cutting up newspapers while pretending to be hurt or scared when Dill passes by. Meanwhile, Dill plays the part of a villain towards Jem. They develop and refine this play over time, adding dialogue and altering scenes daily. The plot is inspired by gossip and neighborhood legends about the mysterious Radley family, particularly focusing on Boo Radley.                                                                                                                                                            | ['Radley and lost all her money. She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her \nright forefinger (Dill’s contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldn’t find \nany cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the \ntime, while Boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house.\nThe three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for a \nchange; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with \nthe brushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff, \nassorted townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the \nRadleys than anybody in Maycomb.\nWhen it was time to play Boo’s big scene, Jem would sneak into the house, steal \nthe scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when Calpurnia’s back was turned, \nthen sit in the swing and cut up newspapers. Dill would walk by, cough at Jem, \nand Jem would fake a plunge into Dill’s thigh.

| Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23.                                                      | In Chapter 23, Jem initially shares a similar view to Scout, that there is only one kind of folks. However, Jem starts questioning this belief when he ponders why people who are supposedly alike cannot get along with each other if they are all the same kind. He expresses his thoughts about understanding the reason behind Boo Radley's seclusion and suggests it might be because he chooses to stay inside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ['Naw, Jem, I think there’s just one kind of \nfolks. Folks.”\nJem turned around and punched his pillow. When he settled back his face was \ncloudy. He was going into one of his declines, and I grew wary. His brows came \ntogether; his mouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while.\n“That’s what I thought, too,” he said at last, “when I was your age. If there’s just \none kind of folks, why can’t they get along with each other? If they’re all alike, \nwhy do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I’m \nbeginning to understand something. I think I’m beginning to understand why Boo \nRadley’s stayed shut up in the house all this time… it’s because he wants to stay \ninside.”\nContents - Prev / Next\nChapter 24\nCalpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron.

| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | In the provided context, Aunt Alexandra seems to use the term "our kind of folks" to refer to people who share similar social norms or manners. However, she doesn't explicitly define what she means by 'good folks' or 'fine folks'. On the other hand, Scout seems to perceive 'good folks' as individuals who are kind and respectable, but this is not contradictory to Aunt Alexandra's statement as she qualifies them as 'not our kind of folks'. Scout also doesn't seem to understand the specific criteria Aunt Alexandra uses to differentiate between 'good folks' and 'our kind of folks'. The contrast between their understandings lies in the fact that Aunt Alexandra appears to consider social status or adherence to certain social norms as important, while Scout values kindness and respectability.                              | ['“Why not, Aunty? \nThey’re good folks.”\nShe looked at me over her sewing glasses. “Jean Louise, there is no doubt in my \nmind that they’re good folks.

| According to the NIST document, what are some examples of privacy compromise attacks in predictive AI systems?                                                                          | The text from the provided context mentions one example of a privacy compromise attack in predictive AI systems as the "Privacy Compromise" attack. This attack results in the unintended leakage of restricted or proprietary information from a PredAI system, such as details about a model's training data, weights, or architecture.

The deployment stage is also mentioned as a separate stage where the model is used in a live or real-world environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ['model inference during the deployment stage. \nTraining-time attacks.

Instead, the implementation occurs as needed, often in response to specific events or circumstances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ['108 \n \nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL \n35.

That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | A Mockingbird.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     nan        |           0.936175 |            1        |       nan        | recursive_character |

When the attacker has access to a high-quality classifier \nthat judges whether model output is harmful, it may be used as a reward function to \ntrain a generative model to generate jailbreaks of another generative model. Only \nquery access is required for each of the models, and no human intervention is re-\nquired to update or refine a candidate jailbreak. The prompts may also be transfer-\nable from the target model to other closed-source LLMs [73].'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | A jailbreak is a direct prompting attack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as bypassing refusal behavior to enable misuse.                                                                                                                                                                                               |     nan        |           0.9876   |            1        |       nan        | recursive_character |

| In 'To Kill a Mockingbird', what is Boo Radley's real first name?                                                                                                                       | The text provided does not reveal Boo Radley's real first name in "To Kill a Mockingbird." However, it mentions Atticus refers to him as Mr. Arthur Radley. This suggests that his full name might be Mr. Arthur Radley, but only the initial 'A' is explicitly mentioned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ['Contents - Prev / Next\nChapter 30\n“Mr. Arthur, honey,” said Atticus, gently correcting me. “Jean Louise, this is Mr. \nArthur Radley.

This interpretation comes from the fact that the story is presented as her recollections of events that took place in her childhood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ['1960\nTO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD\nby Harper Lee\nCopyright (C) 1960 by Harper Lee\nCopyright (C) renewed 1988 by Harper Lee\nPublished by arrangement with McIntosh and Otis, Inc. \n \nCONTENTS'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The story is narrated by Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       0        |           0.988477 |            0.5      |       nan        | recursive_character |

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | In the provided context, a white-box attack is an attack that requires extensive knowledge of the ML system, including its training data, architecture, or parameters. On the other hand, a black-box attack does not require any such knowledge and can be mounted even without access to the model's training data, source code, or model parameters. The document provides more details on attacker knowledge and definitions of these attacks in Sec. 2.1.4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ['These attacks are the most practical since they assume that the attacker has no knowledge \nof the AI system and utilizes system interfaces readily available for normal use. \nGray-box attacks.

In this game, they assume various roles, including villains and townsfolk, and incorporate elements of dialogue and plot. Jem represents Boo Radley in some scenes, hiding under the front steps and shrieking or howling. Dill takes on different character parts and excels at them. The game has a significant scene where Jem sneaks into the Radley house to steal scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when Calpurnia's back is turned, possibly signifying an adventure or conflict with Boo Radley.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ['and sweep the porch.

| Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23.                                                      | In the given excerpt from Chapter 23, both Jem and Scout are discussing their observations about differences among people. Initially, Scout questions why certain individuals despise each other despite being alike. However, she seems to be referring to a more superficial level of similarity or difference. On the other hand, Jem suggests that there is something beyond shared background and financial status that sets people apart. This distinction indicates that Jem appears to perceive a deeper or more nuanced level of differences among individuals compared to Scout at this point in the narrative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ['folks.

| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | In the provided context, Aunt Alexandra does not explicitly define what she means by "fine folks." However, her statement "They’re good folks. But they’re not our kind of folks" suggests that she distinguishes between 'good folks' and those who belong to her social circle, or as Scout calls it, 'our kind'. It is also implied that the contrast in their understanding lies in the social status, manners, or interests of these people. Scout, on the other hand, seems to see 'fine folks' simply as 'good folks', without any distinction based on social standing or shared interests. This interpretation is further supported by her questioning why Aunt Alexandra denies Jem's invitation and Jem explaining that Aunt Alexandra refers to them as 'yappy' (tacky) people who like activities such as fiddling, which Scout also enjoys. | ['with us sometime, okay, Jem?”\n“We’ll see about that,” Aunt Alexandra said, a declaration that with her was \nalways a threat, never a promise.

| What are the three main attacker objectives in the taxonomy of attacks on predictive AI (PredAI) systems as defined in the NIST document?                                               | The text from the provided context indicates that the attacker objectives for PredAI systems can be classified broadly along the dimensions of availability, integrity, and privacy. Additionally, there is a GenAI-specific category of attacks designed to enable misuse.

| According to the NIST document, what are some examples of privacy compromise attacks in predictive AI systems?                                                                          | The provided context mentions that a Privacy Compromise attack in predictive AI systems causes unintended leakage of restricted or proprietary information, such as details about a model's training data, weights, or architecture [100, 309]. It is also highlighted that these attacks can occur at deployment time and do not necessarily depend on the training method used or whether data confidentiality was maintained during training. However, the context does not explicitly provide specific examples of privacy compromise attacks in predictive AI systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ['They have been designed for centralized learning [222] and federated learning [22, 36]. \nPrivacy compromise [NISTAML.03] [Back to Index].

| What are the two broad classes of AI systems distinguished in the NIST AI 100-2e2025 report?                                                                                            | The text indicates that there is a taxonomy for Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) on Predictive AI Systems. However, it does not specify exactly two broad classes of AI systems distinguished in the report. Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot definitively say what the two broad classes of AI systems are in the NIST AI 100-2e2025 report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nExecutive Summary \nThis NIST Trustworthy and Responsible AI report describes a taxonomy and terminology \nfor ADVERSARIAL MACHINE LEARNING (AML) that may aid in securing applications of artificial \nintelligence (AI) against adversarial manipulations and attacks.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The report distinguishes between two broad classes of AI systems: predictive AI (PredAI) and generative AI (GenAI).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     nan        |           0.833333 |            0        |         1        | hierarchical        |

| What are the three primary classes of defenses against adversarial evasion attacks, according to the NIST AI report?                                                                    | Based on the provided context, it appears that there is a discussion about mitigations for each class of attacks in the document. For adversarial evasion attacks (which are introduced in section 2.2), no specific defense classes are explicitly mentioned within the given context. However, it is stated that corresponding sets of mitigations are provided in the attack class sections.

| Summarize the plot of the 'Boo Radley' game that Jem, Scout, and Dill play.                                                                                                             | In the provided context, it appears that Jem, Scout, and their friend Dill engage in a game involving Boo Radley, a reclusive neighbor. The objective of the game seems to be to observe or spy on Boo Radley from a distance, such as peeping through a window with a loose shutter, and imitating his behavior. Jem often plays the role of Boo, hiding under the front steps and making noises, while Dill portrays Mr. Radley, walking up and down the sidewalk and coughing when addressed. As summer progresses, it seems that the game continues to evolve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ['“Well?” said Dill.\n“Okay,” said Jem. “Why don’t you go on home, Scout?”\n“What are you gonna do?”\nDill and Jem were simply going to peep in the window with the loose shutter to \nsee if they could get a look at Boo Radley, and if I didn’t want to go with them I \ncould go straight home and keep my fat flopping mouth shut, that was all.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | The game is a 'melancholy little drama' based on neighborhood gossip.

| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | In the provided context, there is no explicit definition of 'Fine Folks' given by Aunt Alexandra. However, her opinion, though obliquely expressed, seems to suggest that a family being 'fine' is related to how long they have inhabited a particular piece of land. This contrasts with Scout's understanding, as she appears to view 'Fine Folks' as those who do the best they can with the sense they have, regardless of their lineage or property ownership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ['I never understood her preoccupation with heredity.
