Multiple attack classes that require the \nsame capabilities to reach the same objective are shown in a single callout. \nThese attacks are classified according to the following dimensions: 1) learning method and \nstage of the learning process when the attack is mounted, 2) attacker goals and objectives, \n4'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The three main attacker objectives are availability breakdown, integrity violation, and privacy compromise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |     nan        |           0.954297 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

This report is not intended to provide \nan exhaustive survey of all available literature on Adversarial ML, which includes \nmore than 11,354 references on arXiv.org since 2021 as of July 2024. \nThis report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems. Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques.

Backdoor attacks are the only attacks in the literature that require both training \nand testing data control. Model poisoning attacks could result in either targeted or back-\ndoor attacks, and the attacker modifies model parameters to cause an integrity violation. \nThey have been designed for centralized learning [222] and federated learning [22, 36]. \nPrivacy compromise [NISTAML.03] [Back to Index]. A PRIVACY COMPROMISE attack causes \nthe unintended leakage of restricted or proprietary information from a PredAI system, in-\ncluding details about a model’s training data, weights, or architecture [100, 309]. While \nthe term “confidentiality” is more widely used in taxonomies of traditional cybersecurity \nattacks, the AML field has tended to use the top-level term “privacy” to encompass both \nattacks against the confidentiality of a model (e.g., those that extract information about a \nmodel’s weights or architecture) and those that cause violations of expected privacy prop-\nerties of model outputs (e.g. by exposing model training data) [310]. DATA CONFIDENTIAL-\nITY during ML training can be achieved through secure computation methods based on \ncryptographic techniques [2, 253, 288, 385], which ensure that training data and model \nparameters remain protected during the training phase. However, even models trained \nusing paradigms that enforce data confidentiality may be vulnerable to privacy attacks, in \nwhich adversaries interacting with a model can extract information about its training data \nor parameters. In this report, we focus on privacy compromises that can occur at deploy-\nment time, regardless of the training method used, or whether data confidentiality was \nmaintained during training. \nIn privacy attacks, attackers might be interested in learning information about the training \ndata (resulting in DATA PRIVACY ATTACKS) or the ML model (resulting in MODEL PRIVACY AT-\nTACKS).'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Examples include data reconstruction, membership-inference attacks, training data extraction, attribute inference attacks, and property inference.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |       1        |           0.933423 |            1        |         1        | sentence_splitter   |

Privacy Attacks and Mitigations \n[NISTAML.03] [Back to Index] \nThe seminal work of Dinur and Nissim [110] introduced DATA RECONSTRUCTION attacks, \nwhich seek to reverse-engineer private information about an individual user record or \nother sensitive input data from access to a trained model. More recently, data recon-\nstruction attacks have been designed for binary and multi-class neural network classi-\nfiers [50, 152]. With MEMBERSHIP-INFERENCE ATTACK, an adversary can determine whether \na particular record was included in the dataset used for training an ML model. Mem-\nbership inference attacks were first introduced by Homer et al. [162] for genomic data. \nRecent literature focuses on membership attacks against ML models in mostly black-box \nsettings in which adversaries have query access to a trained ML model [54, 342, 422]. Prop-\nerty inference attacks [19, 74, 134, 233, 361, 437] aim to extract global information about \na training dataset, such as the fraction of training examples with a certain sensitive at-\ntribute. A different privacy violation for MLaaS is MODEL EXTRACTION attacks, which are \ndesigned to extract information about an ML model, such as its architecture or model pa-\nrameters3 \n3A privacy violation in this context describes a loss of confidential information about an ML model. If ML \nmodel leakage leads to further privacy violations for individuals (e.g., identity theft, sensitive data extrac-\ntion), it may also be viewed as a cybersecurity-related privacy event. For further discussion on the relation-\nship between privacy and cybersecurity risks, see NIST Privacy Framework, Version 1.0. \n[58, 70, 177, 376]. \nThis section discusses privacy attacks related to data reconstruction, the memorization of \ntraining data, membership inference, property inference, and model extraction, as well as \nmitigations for some of these attacks and open problems in designing general mitigation \nstrategies. \n2.4.1.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| What are the GenAI Stages of Learning according to the Machine Learning pdf?                                                                                                            | The context provided does not explicitly mention the stages of learning for Generative AI (GenAI). However, it does discuss the stages of learning in a section labeled as '2.1. Attack Classification' and further broken down as '2.1.1. Stages of Learning'. This suggests that there might be some connection between these stages and those of Generative AI. To confirm the stages of learning for GenAI, I would recommend referring to the specific section related to it in the document provided (3.1.1. GenAI Stages of Learning).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ['2.4.2.

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

There is an inherent trade-off between robustness and accuracy [374, 379, 433]. \nSimilarly, there are trade-offs between a model’s robustness and fairness guarantees [71]. \n2.2.1. White-Box Evasion Attacks \nIn\n the white-box threat model, the attacker has full knowledge of the model architecture \nand parameters, as discussed in Section 2.1.4. The main challenge for creating adversarial \nexamples in this setting is to find a perturbation added to a testing sample that changes its \nclassification label, often with constraints on properties such as the perceptibility or size \nof the perturbation. In the white-box threat model, it is common to craft adversarial ex-\namples by solving an optimization problem written from the attacker’s perspective, which \nspecifies the objective function for the optimization (such as changing the target label to \na certain class), as well as a distance metric to measure the similarity between the testing \nsample and the adversarial example. \nOptimization-based methods. Szedegy et al. [362] and Biggio et al. [38] independently \nproposed the use of optimization techniques to generate adversarial examples. In their \nthreat models, the adversary is allowed to inspect the entirety of the ML model and com-\npute gradients relative to the model’s loss function. These attacks can be targeted (i.e., the \nadversarial example’s class is selected by the attacker) or untargeted (i.e., the adversarial \nexamples are misclassified to any other incorrect class). \nSzedegy et al. [362] coined the widely used term adversarial examples. They considered an \nobjective that minimized the ` 2 norm of the perturbation subject to the model prediction \nchanging to the target class.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | An adversarial example is a modified testing sample that induces misclassification or misbehavior of a machine learning model at deployment time.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |     nan        |           0.869516 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

In an evasion attack, the adversary’s goal is to generate \nadversarial examples: samples whose classification can be changed to an arbitrary class \nof the attacker’s choice – often with only minimal perturbation [362]. For example, in the \ncontext of image classification, the perturbation of the original sample might be small so \nthat a human cannot observe the transformation of the input; while the ML model can \nbe tricked to classify the adversarial example in the target class selected by the attacker, \nhumans still recognize it as part of the original class. \nEarly known instances of evasion attacks date back to 1988 with the work of Kearns and \nLi [192] and 2004 when Dalvi et al. [98] and Lowd and Meek [226] demonstrated the ex-\nistence of adversarial examples for linear classifiers used in spam filters. Later, Szedegy \net al. [362] showed that deep neural networks used for image classification could be eas-\nily manipulated through adversarial examples. In 2013, Szedegy et al. [362] and Biggio \net al. [38] independently discovered an effective method for generating adversarial exam-\nples against linear models and neural networks by applying gradient optimization to an \nadversarial objective function. Both of these techniques require white-box access to the \nmodel and were improved by subsequent methods that generated adversarial examples \nwith even smaller perturbations [20, 65, 232]. \nAdversarial examples are also applicable in more realistic black-box settings in which at-\ntackers only obtain query access capabilities to the trained model. Even in the more chal-\nlenging black-box setting in which attackers obtain the model’s predicted labels or confi-\ndence scores, deep neural networks are still vulnerable to adversarial examples.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age. If your father was thirty you’d find life quite \ndifferent.”\n“I sure would. Atticus can’t do anything…”\n“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”\n“What can he do?”\n“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”\n“Shoot…”\n“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town?

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022.

Further, IGs should explain in CyberScope the impact this has on the IGs \nability to determine the effectiveness of their agency’s information security program.  \n \nTh\ne tables below show the IG metrics for FY25 IG evaluation period.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | The OIG should consider closing the recommendation with a status of 'Unresolved - Closed' and, if appropriate, issue an updated and refocused recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                            |       0.8      |           0.937918 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

As a general best practice, broad recommendations should be \navoided.  Recommendations should be focused on specific actions to address the root cause and \nlead the agency to that next maturity level.  It may require several recommendations to get that \nmetric to the next level, however this provides the agency with specific guidance and the \nopportunity to make steady and visible progress.  This approach would also allow the assessors \nto follow-up on agency actions taken as part of their recommendation follow-up processes and/or \nthe next FISMA evaluation.  It is a matter of opinion, however generally a higher quantity of \nspecific recommendations is preferable over fewer broad recommendations.  \n \nH\now should agencies consider plans of action and milestone (POA&M)? \nAs part of the data collection process, it is recommended that assessors collect and consider open \nPOA&Ms that the organization has self-identified (or other means, such as past GAO or OIG \nreports, or assessment and authorization reviews) as issues they are working to resolve.  As a \nbest practice, assessors should avoid issuing recommendations that the organization is aware of \nand actively working to resolve.  To re-emphasize the open POA&M assessors should consider \nreferencing them in the narrative write up.  Another potential approach would be to issue an \n“Opportunity for Improvement” (OFI) or an “Item for Management’s Consideration” (IMC) to \nstate that the organization should prioritize the POA&M in order to continue to mature the \nmetric, domain, or program.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022.

This report is not intended to provide \nan exhaustive survey of all available literature on Adversarial ML, which includes \nmore than 11,354 references on arXiv.org since 2021 as of July 2024. \nThis report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems. Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques. The intent is to raise awareness of open questions in the \nfield of AML and to call attention to trends that may shape risk and risk management \npractices in future. \n3']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| In the context of Generative AI, what is a 'jailbreak'?                                                                                                                                 | A jailbreak, in the context of Generative AI, refers to a method or technique used to bypass safety measures or limitations imposed on a generative model. This could be achieved through various means such as the use of high-quality classifiers and adaptive attacks that include seemingly harmless prompts, eventually leading to successful manipulation or exploitation of the model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ['When the attacker has access to a high-quality classifier \nthat judges whether model output is harmful, it may be used as a reward function to \ntrain a generative model to generate jailbreaks of another generative model. Only \nquery access is required for each of the models, and no human intervention is re-\nquired to update or refine a candidate jailbreak. The prompts may also be transfer-\nable from the target model to other closed-source LLMs [73]. \nThe Crescendo attack [316] introduced the idea of interacting with the model itera-\ntively in a multi-turn adaptive attack that includes seemingly benign prompts, even-\ntually leading to a successful jailbreak against safety alignment. The initial manual \nattack is fully automated by leveraging another LLM for prompt generation and in-\ncorporating multiple input sources. \n45'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | A jailbreak is a direct prompting attack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as bypassing refusal behavior to enable misuse.                                                                                                                                                                                               |       1        |           0.989129 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques. The intent is to raise awareness of open questions in the \nfield of AML and to call attention to trends that may shape risk and risk management \npractices in future. \n3'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The three main classes of defenses against evasion attacks are adversarial training, randomized smoothing, and formal verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       0.8      |           0.984252 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

These are demonstrations of evasion vulnerabilities by researchers, \nbut did not result in attacks in the wild. \n2.2.5. Mitigations \nMitig\nating evasion attacks is challenging because adversarial examples are widespread in \na variety of ML model architectures and application domains. Possible explanations for \nthe existence of adversarial examples are that ML models rely on non-robust features that \nare not aligned with human perception in the computer vision domain [174]. In the last \nfew years, many of the proposed mitigations against adversarial examples have been in-\neffective against stronger attacks. Furthermore, several papers have performed extensive \nevaluations and defeated a large number of proposed mitigations: \n• Carlini and Wagner showed how to bypass 10 methods for detecting adversarial ex-\namples and described several guidelines for evaluating defenses [64]. Recent work \nshows that detecting adversarial examples is as difficult as building a defense [373]. \nTherefore, this direction for mitigating adversarial examples is similarly challenging \nas designing defenses. \n• The Obfuscated Gradients attack [20] was specifically designed to defeat several pro-\nposed defenses that rely on masking gradients to protect against optimization-based \nattacks. It relies on a new technique, Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation, \nwhich approximates the gradient during the backward pass of backpropagation, and \nwas shown to bypass several proposed defenses based on gradient masking. \n• Tramèr et al. [375] described a methodology for designing adaptive attacks against \nproposed defenses and circumvented 13 existing defenses. They advocate for de-\nsigning adaptive attacks to test newly proposed defenses rather than merely testing \nthe defenses against well-known attacks. \nFrom the wide range of proposed defenses against adversarial evasion attacks, three main \nclasses have proven to be resilient and have the potential to provide mitigation against \nevasion attacks: \n1.

You plug ‘em with cement when they’re sick. You ought to know \nthat, Jem.”\nJem said nothing more about it until late afternoon. When we passed our tree he \ngave it a meditative pat on its cement, and remained deep in thought. He seemed \nto be working himself into a bad humor, so I kept my distance.\nAs usual, we met Atticus coming home from work that evening. When we were at \nour steps Jem said, “Atticus, look down yonder at that tree, please sir.”\n“What tree, son?”\n“The one on the corner of the Radley lot comin‘ from school.”\n“Yes?”\n“Is that tree dyin‘?”\n“Why no, son, I don’t think so. Look at the leaves, they’re all green and full, no \nbrown patches anywhere—”\n“It ain’t even sick?”\n“That tree’s as healthy as you are, Jem. Why?”\n“Mr. Nathan Radley said it was dyin‘.”\n“Well maybe it is. I’m sure Mr. Radley knows more about his trees than we do.”\nAtticus left us on the porch.

She gave the money to Dill, who went to the picture show \ntwenty times on it.\n“Don’t have any picture shows here, except Jesus ones in the courthouse \nsometimes,” said Jem. “Ever see anything good?”']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

He had been lying on the grass. “You \nlittle folks won’t tell on me now, will you? It’d ruin my reputation if you did.”\n“You mean all you drink in that sack’s Coca-Cola? Just plain Coca-Cola?”\n“Yes ma’am,” Mr. Raymond nodded. I liked his smell: it was of leather, horses, \ncottonseed. He wore the only English riding boots I had ever seen. “That’s all I \ndrink, most of the time.”\n“Then you just pretend you’re half—? I beg your pardon, sir,” I caught myself. “I \ndidn’t mean to be—”\nMr. Raymond chuckled, not at all offended, and I tried to frame a discreet \nquestion: “Why do you do like you do?”\n“Wh—oh yes, you mean why do I pretend? Well, it’s very simple,” he said. \n“Some folks don’t—like the way I live. Now I could say the hell with ‘em, I don’t \ncare if they don’t like it. I do say I don’t care if they don’t like it, right enough—\nbut I don’t say the hell with ’em, see?”\nDill and I said, “No sir.”\n“I try to give ‘em a reason, you see. It helps folks if they can latch onto a reason. \nWhen I come to town, which is seldom, if I weave a little and drink out of this \nsack, folks can say Dolphus Raymond’s in the clutches of whiskey—that’s why \nhe won’t change his ways. He can’t help himself, that’s why he lives the way he \ndoes.”\n“That ain’t honest, Mr.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | He drinks Coca-Cola.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       0.5      |           0.956662 |            1        |       nan        | sentence_splitter   |

It was still \nblack dark. The remaining cars were parked on the other side of the building, and \ntheir headlights were little help. “If some of ‘em were goin’ in our direction we \ncould see better,” said Jem. “Here Scout, let me hold onto your—hock.

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | The provided document does not explicitly explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack. However, it can be inferred that these are types of evasion attacks mentioned in the context (page label 2.2). A white-box attack is an attack where the attacker has full knowledge and access to the system being targeted, including its source code or internal workings. On the other hand, a black-box attack is carried out without any such knowledge; the attacker only has access to the system's input/output interfaces. In summary, the main difference lies in the level of information available to the attacker during the attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ['4 \n2.1.1.

| Summarize the plot of the 'Boo Radley' game that Jem, Scout, and Dill play.                                                                                                             | The 'Boo Radley' game is a dramatic performance invented by Jem, Scout, and Dill. In this game, they act out a small play involving Boo Radley, who is depicted as a mysterious character living in a house. Jem plays the role of Boo, Dill portrays various villainous characters, and Scout acts as Mrs. Radley or other female characters. The story involves Boo being a reclusive figure, his wife having lost her beauty and most of her body parts due to a tragic marriage, and him biting off his right forefinger when he couldn't find food.

Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up and down the \nsidewalk and coughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally, was Boo: he went \nunder the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time.\nAs the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected it, added \ndialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang \nchanges every day.\nDill was a villain’s villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and \nappear tall if height was part of the devilry required. He was as good as his worst \nperformance; his worst performance was Gothic. I reluctantly played assorted \nladies who entered the script. I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I \nplayed that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jem’s assurances that \nBoo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in \nthe daytime and Atticus home at night.\nJem was a born hero.\nIt was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and \nneighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr. \nRadley and lost all her money. She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her \nright forefinger (Dill’s contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldn’t find \nany cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the \ntime, while Boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house.\nThe three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for a \nchange; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with \nthe brushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff, \nassorted townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the \nRadleys than anybody in Maycomb.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23.                                                      | In the provided context, it appears that both Jem and Scout are discussing the concept of 'folk' with their father Atticus. While Jem seems to understand that some folks might not share the same interests or behaviors as their own family (as indicated by his statement "She means they’re yappy, Scout," where 'yappy' likely refers to being talkative or noisy), he does not seem to question their inherent goodness. In contrast, Scout seems more inclined to judge people based on their actions and whether they are perceived as good or bad, rather than focusing on differences in interests or behaviors.

Perhaps this was why she had come to live with us—to help us \nchoose our friends. I would hold her off as long as I could: “If they’re good folks, \nthen why can’t I be nice to Walter?”\n“I didn’t say not to be nice to him. You should be friendly and polite to him, you \nshould be gracious to everybody, dear.

Multiple attack classes that require the \nsame capabilities to reach the same objective are shown in a single callout. \nThese attacks are classified according to the following dimensions: 1) learning method and \nstage of the learning process when the attack is mounted, 2) attacker goals and objectives, \n4'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The three main attacker objectives are availability breakdown, integrity violation, and privacy compromise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |     nan        |           0.976651 |            1        |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

This report is not intended to provide \nan exhaustive survey of all available literature on Adversarial ML, which includes \nmore than 11,354 references on arXiv.org since 2021 as of July 2024. \nThis report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems. Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques.

| According to the NIST document, what are some examples of privacy compromise attacks in predictive AI systems?                                                                          | In the provided NIST document, there are several examples of privacy compromise attacks mentioned in Predictive AI (PredAI) systems. These include Data Reconstruction attacks, Membership Inference attacks, Property Inference attacks, and Model Extraction attacks. Each of these attacks targets different aspects of the system or the data used for training, such as learning information about the training data (Data Privacy Attacks), determining whether a particular record was included in the dataset used for training an ML model (Membership Inference Attacks), extracting global information about a training dataset (Property Inference Attacks), and revealing information about an ML model like its architecture or parameters (Model Extraction Attacks).                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ['NIST AI 100-2e2025 \nMarch 2025 \nwhich is added to both the poisoned samples and the testing samples to cause misclassi-\nfication. Backdoor attacks are the only attacks in the literature that require both training \nand testing data control. Model poisoning attacks could result in either targeted or back-\ndoor attacks, and the attacker modifies model parameters to cause an integrity violation. \nThey have been designed for centralized learning [222] and federated learning [22, 36]. \nPrivacy compromise [NISTAML.03] [Back to Index]. A PRIVACY COMPROMISE attack causes \nthe unintended leakage of restricted or proprietary information from a PredAI system, in-\ncluding details about a model’s training data, weights, or architecture [100, 309]. While \nthe term “confidentiality” is more widely used in taxonomies of traditional cybersecurity \nattacks, the AML field has tended to use the top-level term “privacy” to encompass both \nattacks against the confidentiality of a model (e.g., those that extract information about a \nmodel’s weights or architecture) and those that cause violations of expected privacy prop-\nerties of model outputs (e.g. by exposing model training data) [310]. DATA CONFIDENTIAL-\nITY during ML training can be achieved through secure computation methods based on \ncryptographic techniques [2, 253, 288, 385], which ensure that training data and model \nparameters remain protected during the training phase. However, even models trained \nusing paradigms that enforce data confidentiality may be vulnerable to privacy attacks, in \nwhich adversaries interacting with a model can extract information about its training data \nor parameters. In this report, we focus on privacy compromises that can occur at deploy-\nment time, regardless of the training method used, or whether data confidentiality was \nmaintained during training. \nIn privacy attacks, attackers might be interested in learning information about the training \ndata (resulting in DATA PRIVACY ATTACKS) or the ML model (resulting in MODEL PRIVACY AT-\nTACKS).

Privacy Attacks and Mitigations \n[NISTAML.03] [Back to Index] \nThe seminal work of Dinur and Nissim [110] introduced DATA RECONSTRUCTION attacks, \nwhich seek to reverse-engineer private information about an individual user record or \nother sensitive input data from access to a trained model. More recently, data recon-\nstruction attacks have been designed for binary and multi-class neural network classi-\nfiers [50, 152]. With MEMBERSHIP-INFERENCE ATTACK, an adversary can determine whether \na particular record was included in the dataset used for training an ML model. Mem-\nbership inference attacks were first introduced by Homer et al. [162] for genomic data. \nRecent literature focuses on membership attacks against ML models in mostly black-box \nsettings in which adversaries have query access to a trained ML model [54, 342, 422]. Prop-\nerty inference attacks [19, 74, 134, 233, 361, 437] aim to extract global information about \na training dataset, such as the fraction of training examples with a certain sensitive at-\ntribute. A different privacy violation for MLaaS is MODEL EXTRACTION attacks, which are \ndesigned to extract information about an ML model, such as its architecture or model pa-\nrameters3 \n3A privacy violation in this context describes a loss of confidential information about an ML model. If ML \nmodel leakage leads to further privacy violations for individuals (e.g., identity theft, sensitive data extrac-\ntion), it may also be viewed as a cybersecurity-related privacy event. For further discussion on the relation-\nship between privacy and cybersecurity risks, see NIST Privacy Framework, Version 1.0. \n[58, 70, 177, 376]. \nThis section discusses privacy attacks related to data reconstruction, the memorization of \ntraining data, membership inference, property inference, and model extraction, as well as \nmitigations for some of these attacks and open problems in designing general mitigation \nstrategies. \n2.4.1.

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.

White-Box Evasion Attacks \nIn\n the white-box threat model, the attacker has full knowledge of the model architecture \nand parameters, as discussed in Section 2.1.4. The main challenge for creating adversarial \nexamples in this setting is to find a perturbation added to a testing sample that changes its \nclassification label, often with constraints on properties such as the perceptibility or size \nof the perturbation. In the white-box threat model, it is common to craft adversarial ex-\namples by solving an optimization problem written from the attacker’s perspective, which \nspecifies the objective function for the optimization (such as changing the target label to \na certain class), as well as a distance metric to measure the similarity between the testing \nsample and the adversarial example. \nOptimization-based methods. Szedegy et al. [362] and Biggio et al. [38] independently \nproposed the use of optimization techniques to generate adversarial examples. In their \nthreat models, the adversary is allowed to inspect the entirety of the ML model and com-\npute gradients relative to the model’s loss function. These attacks can be targeted (i.e., the \nadversarial example’s class is selected by the attacker) or untargeted (i.e., the adversarial \nexamples are misclassified to any other incorrect class). \nSzedegy et al. [362] coined the widely used term adversarial examples. They considered an \nobjective that minimized the ` 2 norm of the perturbation subject to the model prediction \nchanging to the target class.

Evasion Attacks and Mitigations \n[NISTAML.022] [Back to Index] \nThe discovery of evasion attacks against ML models has led to significant growth in AML \nresearch over the last decade. In an evasion attack, the adversary’s goal is to generate \nadversarial examples: samples whose classification can be changed to an arbitrary class \nof the attacker’s choice – often with only minimal perturbation [362]. For example, in the \ncontext of image classification, the perturbation of the original sample might be small so \nthat a human cannot observe the transformation of the input; while the ML model can \nbe tricked to classify the adversarial example in the target class selected by the attacker, \nhumans still recognize it as part of the original class. \nEarly known instances of evasion attacks date back to 1988 with the work of Kearns and \nLi [192] and 2004 when Dalvi et al. [98] and Lowd and Meek [226] demonstrated the ex-\nistence of adversarial examples for linear classifiers used in spam filters. Later, Szedegy \net al. [362] showed that deep neural networks used for image classification could be eas-\nily manipulated through adversarial examples. In 2013, Szedegy et al. [362] and Biggio \net al. [38] independently discovered an effective method for generating adversarial exam-\nples against linear models and neural networks by applying gradient optimization to an \nadversarial objective function. Both of these techniques require white-box access to the \nmodel and were improved by subsequent methods that generated adversarial examples \nwith even smaller perturbations [20, 65, 232]. \nAdversarial examples are also applicable in more realistic black-box settings in which at-\ntackers only obtain query access capabilities to the trained model. Even in the more chal-\nlenging black-box setting in which attackers obtain the model’s predicted labels or confi-\ndence scores, deep neural networks are still vulnerable to adversarial examples.

This belief is shared by both Atticus Finch and Miss Maudie. Mockingbirds are depicted as creatures that only bring joy and music to people without causing harm, making their killing undesirable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ['know you’ll go after birds. Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age. If your father was thirty you’d find life quite \ndifferent.”\n“I sure would. Atticus can’t do anything…”\n“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”\n“What can he do?”\n“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”\n“Shoot…”\n“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town? Why, down at the \nLanding when we were coming up, Atticus Finch could beat everybody on both \nsides of the river.”'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | A Mockingbird.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |       1        |           0.91506  |            1        |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022.

Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022.

As a general best practice, broad recommendations should be \navoided.  Recommendations should be focused on specific actions to address the root cause and \nlead the agency to that next maturity level.  It may require several recommendations to get that \nmetric to the next level, however this provides the agency with specific guidance and the \nopportunity to make steady and visible progress.  This approach would also allow the assessors \nto follow-up on agency actions taken as part of their recommendation follow-up processes and/or \nthe next FISMA evaluation.  It is a matter of opinion, however generally a higher quantity of \nspecific recommendations is preferable over fewer broad recommendations.  \n \nH\now should agencies consider plans of action and milestone (POA&M)? \nAs part of the data collection process, it is recommended that assessors collect and consider open \nPOA&Ms that the organization has self-identified (or other means, such as past GAO or OIG \nreports, or assessment and authorization reviews) as issues they are working to resolve.  As a \nbest practice, assessors should avoid issuing recommendations that the organization is aware of \nand actively working to resolve.  To re-emphasize the open POA&M assessors should consider \nreferencing them in the narrative write up.  Another potential approach would be to issue an \n“Opportunity for Improvement” (OFI) or an “Item for Management’s Consideration” (IMC) to \nstate that the organization should prioritize the POA&M in order to continue to mature the \nmetric, domain, or program.

Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022.

This report is not intended to provide \nan exhaustive survey of all available literature on Adversarial ML, which includes \nmore than 11,354 references on arXiv.org since 2021 as of July 2024. \nThis report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems. Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques. The intent is to raise awareness of open questions in the \nfield of AML and to call attention to trends that may shape risk and risk management \npractices in future. \n3']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

This could be used to enable misuse, invade privacy, or violate integrity. It involves manipulating tool usage and API calls, potentially compromising the backend of the system, for example by executing attacker's SQL queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ['220, 337], \nsuch as to: \n• Enable misuse. Attackers may use direct prompting attacks to bypass model-level \ndefenses that a model developer or deployer has created to restrict models from \nproducing harmful or undesirable output [237]. A JAILBREAK is a direct prompting \nattack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as circum-\nventing refusal behavior to enable misuse. \n• Invade privacy. Attackers may use direct prompting to extract the system prompt \nor reveal private information that was provided to the model in context but not in-\ntended for unfiltered access by the user . \n• Violate integrity. When LLMs are used as agents, an attacker may use direct prompt-\ning attacks to manipulate tool usage and API calls, and potentially compromise the \nbackend of the system (e.g. executing attacker’s SQL queries). \n43'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | A jailbreak is a direct prompting attack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as bypassing refusal behavior to enable misuse.                                                                                                                                                                                               |       1        |           0.989129 |            1        |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

This report is not intended to provide \nan exhaustive survey of all available literature on Adversarial ML, which includes \nmore than 11,354 references on arXiv.org since 2021 as of July 2024. \nThis report is organized into three sections. \n•\n Section 2 considers PredAI systems. Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques. The intent is to raise awareness of open questions in the \nfield of AML and to call attention to trends that may shape risk and risk management \npractices in future. \n3'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The three main classes of defenses against evasion attacks are adversarial training, randomized smoothing, and formal verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       0.833333 |           0.936545 |            1        |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

These are demonstrations of evasion vulnerabilities by researchers, \nbut did not result in attacks in the wild. \n2.2.5. Mitigations \nMitig\nating evasion attacks is challenging because adversarial examples are widespread in \na variety of ML model architectures and application domains. Possible explanations for \nthe existence of adversarial examples are that ML models rely on non-robust features that \nare not aligned with human perception in the computer vision domain [174]. In the last \nfew years, many of the proposed mitigations against adversarial examples have been in-\neffective against stronger attacks. Furthermore, several papers have performed extensive \nevaluations and defeated a large number of proposed mitigations: \n• Carlini and Wagner showed how to bypass 10 methods for detecting adversarial ex-\namples and described several guidelines for evaluating defenses [64]. Recent work \nshows that detecting adversarial examples is as difficult as building a defense [373]. \nTherefore, this direction for mitigating adversarial examples is similarly challenging \nas designing defenses. \n• The Obfuscated Gradients attack [20] was specifically designed to defeat several pro-\nposed defenses that rely on masking gradients to protect against optimization-based \nattacks. It relies on a new technique, Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation, \nwhich approximates the gradient during the backward pass of backpropagation, and \nwas shown to bypass several proposed defenses based on gradient masking. \n• Tramèr et al. [375] described a methodology for designing adaptive attacks against \nproposed defenses and circumvented 13 existing defenses. They advocate for de-\nsigning adaptive attacks to test newly proposed defenses rather than merely testing \nthe defenses against well-known attacks. \nFrom the wide range of proposed defenses against adversarial evasion attacks, three main \nclasses have proven to be resilient and have the potential to provide mitigation against \nevasion attacks: \n1. Adversarial training: Introduced by Goodfellow et al. [144] and further developed \nby Madry et al. [232], adversarial training is a general method that augments train-\ning data with adversarial examples generated iteratively during training using their \ncorrect labels.

You plug ‘em with cement when they’re sick. You ought to know \nthat, Jem.”\nJem said nothing more about it until late afternoon. When we passed our tree he \ngave it a meditative pat on its cement, and remained deep in thought. He seemed \nto be working himself into a bad humor, so I kept my distance.\nAs usual, we met Atticus coming home from work that evening. When we were at \nour steps Jem said, “Atticus, look down yonder at that tree, please sir.”\n“What tree, son?”\n“The one on the corner of the Radley lot comin‘ from school.”\n“Yes?”\n“Is that tree dyin‘?”\n“Why no, son, I don’t think so.

However, it's important to note that while Scout is the main character through which events are narrated and understood, she does not tell the story herself. The unnamed narrator who presents the story is an external entity providing insight into Scout's thoughts and experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ['to the wire fence to see if there was a puppy— Miss Rachel’s rat terrier was \nexpecting— instead we found someone sitting looking at us. Sitting down, he \nwasn’t much higher than the collards. We stared at him until he spoke:\n“Hey.”\n“Hey yourself,” said Jem pleasantly.\n“I’m Charles Baker Harris,” he said. “I can read.”\n“So what?” I said.\n“I just thought you’d like to know I can read. You got anything needs readin‘ I \ncan do it…”\n“How old are you,” asked Jem, “four-and-a-half?”\n“Goin‘ on seven.”\n“Shoot no wonder, then,” said Jem, jerking his thumb at me. “Scout yonder’s \nbeen readin‘ ever since she was born, and she ain’t even started to school yet. You \nlook right puny for goin’ on seven.”\n“I’m little but I’m old,” he said.\nJem brushed his hair back to get a better look. “Why don’t you come over, \nCharles Baker Harris?” he said. “Lord, what a name.”\n“‘s not any funnier’n yours.

Bet it’s a foot longer.”\n“Folks call me Dill,” said Dill, struggling under the fence.\n“Do better if you go over it instead of under it,” I said. “Where’d you come from?”\nDill was from Meridian, Mississippi, was spending the summer with his aunt, \nMiss Rachel, and would be spending every summer in Maycomb from now on. \nHis family was from Maycomb County originally, his mother worked for a \nphotographer in Meridian, had entered his picture in a Beautiful Child contest and \nwon five dollars. She gave the money to Dill, who went to the picture show \ntwenty times on it.\n“Don’t have any picture shows here, except Jesus ones in the courthouse \nsometimes,” said Jem. “Ever see anything good?”'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The story is narrated by Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       0.5      |           0.878295 |            1        |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”\n“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”\n“Been here longer than the town.”\n“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children \naround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so \nare you and Atticus.”\n“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around \nyet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to \nburn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re \nright, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around \nyoung folks much, have you?”\n“Yessum, at school.”\n“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the \nbenefit of your father’s age.

Atticus can’t do anything…”\n“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”\n“What can he do?”\n“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”\n“Shoot…”\n“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town?

He had been lying on the grass. “You \nlittle folks won’t tell on me now, will you? It’d ruin my reputation if you did.”\n“You mean all you drink in that sack’s Coca-Cola? Just plain Coca-Cola?”\n“Yes ma’am,” Mr. Raymond nodded. I liked his smell: it was of leather, horses, \ncottonseed. He wore the only English riding boots I had ever seen. “That’s all I \ndrink, most of the time.”\n“Then you just pretend you’re half—? I beg your pardon, sir,” I caught myself. “I \ndidn’t mean to be—”\nMr. Raymond chuckled, not at all offended, and I tried to frame a discreet \nquestion: “Why do you do like you do?”\n“Wh—oh yes, you mean why do I pretend? Well, it’s very simple,” he said. \n“Some folks don’t—like the way I live. Now I could say the hell with ‘em, I don’t \ncare if they don’t like it. I do say I don’t care if they don’t like it, right enough—\nbut I don’t say the hell with ’em, see?”\nDill and I said, “No sir.”\n“I try to give ‘em a reason, you see. It helps folks if they can latch onto a reason. \nWhen I come to town, which is seldom, if I weave a little and drink out of this \nsack, folks can say Dolphus Raymond’s in the clutches of whiskey—that’s why \nhe won’t change his ways. He can’t help himself, that’s why he lives the way he \ndoes.”\n“That ain’t honest, Mr. Raymond, making yourself out badder’n you are already\n—”\n“It ain’t honest but it’s mighty helpful to folks.

It was still \nblack dark. The remaining cars were parked on the other side of the building, and \ntheir headlights were little help. “If some of ‘em were goin’ in our direction we \ncould see better,” said Jem. “Here Scout, let me hold onto your—hock. You might \nlose your balance.”\n“I can see all right.”\n“Yeah, but you might lose your balance.” I felt a slight pressure on my head, and \nassumed that Jem had grabbed that end of the ham. “You got me?”\n“Uh huh.”\nWe began crossing the black schoolyard, straining to see our feet. “Jem,” I said, \n“I forgot my shoes, they’re back behind the stage.”\n“Well let’s go get ‘em.” But as we turned around the auditorium lights went off. \n“You can get ’em tomorrow,” he said.\n“But tomorrow’s Sunday,” I protested, as Jem turned me homeward.\n“You can get the Janitor to let you in… Scout?”\n“Hm?”\n“Nothing.”\nJem hadn’t started that in a long time. I wondered what he was thinking. He’d tell \nme when he wanted to, probably when we got home. I felt his fingers press the \ntop of my costume, too hard, it seemed. I shook my head. “Jem, you don’t hafta\n—”\n“Hush a minute, Scout,” he said, pinching me.\nWe walked along silently. “Minute’s up,” I said. “Whatcha thinkin‘ about?” I \nturned to look at him, but his outline was barely visible.\n“Thought I heard something,” he said. “Stop a minute.”\nWe stopped.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Arthur 'Boo' Radley.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       0.5      |           0        |            1        |       nan        | token_text_splitter |

| Describe the 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level for the metric regarding an organization's inventory of information systems.                                                     | The 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level refers to a situation where an organization has defined policies, procedures, and processes for developing and maintaining a comprehensive and accurate inventory of its information systems and system interconnections. However, it implies that these policies, procedures, and processes are not yet being consistently implemented or executed as expected. This level suggests that while the foundation is in place, there may be inconsistencies or gaps in execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ['25 \n \nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL \nAssessor Best Practices \nDefined:   \n \nConsistently Implemented:   \n \nManaged and measurable:   \n \nOptimized:    \n \nRisk and Asset Management (RAM) \n7.

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | In the provided document, white-box attacks and black-box attacks are described in the context of evasion attacks. A white-box attack is a type where the attacker has full knowledge of the system, including its architecture and internal workings. This allows them to craft more sophisticated and targeted attacks. On the other hand, a black-box attack is carried out without any knowledge of the system's inner workings. The attacker only has access to the system's input and output interfaces, making their attacks less precise but potentially harder to detect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ['How to Read This Document \nThis document uses the terms “AI technology,” “AI system,” and “AI applications” inter-\nchangeably.

| Summarize the plot of the 'Boo Radley' game that Jem, Scout, and Dill play.                                                                                                             | The children Jem, Scout, and Dill create a small play called 'Boo Radley', based on neighborhood legends about the reclusive Boo Radley. In this game, they assign roles such as villains, heroes, ladies, and other townsfolk. Jem plays the role of Boo Radley in a dramatic scene where he sneaks into the Radley house and steals scissors from a sewing machine drawer. Scout is initially hesitant to participate due to her fear of Boo Radley, but eventually agrees. The game involves various activities like treading water at the gate or hiding under steps to add realism to their play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ['and sweep the porch. Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up and down the \nsidewalk and coughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally, was Boo: he went \nunder the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time.\nAs the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected it, added \ndialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang \nchanges every day.\nDill was a villain’s villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and \nappear tall if height was part of the devilry required. He was as good as his worst \nperformance; his worst performance was Gothic. I reluctantly played assorted \nladies who entered the script. I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I \nplayed that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jem’s assurances that \nBoo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in \nthe daytime and Atticus home at night.\nJem was a born hero.\nIt was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and \nneighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr. \nRadley and lost all her money. She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her \nright forefinger (Dill’s contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldn’t find \nany cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the \ntime, while Boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house.\nThe three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for a \nchange; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with \nthe brushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff, \nassorted townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the \nRadleys than anybody in Maycomb.\nWhen it was time to play Boo’s big scene, Jem would sneak into the house, steal \nthe scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when Calpurnia’s back was turned, \nthen sit in the swing and'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The game is a 'melancholy little drama' based on neighborhood gossip.

Calpurnia set a pitcher and three glasses on the porch, then \nwent about her business. Being out of Jem’s good graces did not worry me \nespecially.

How?” asked Dill.\nJem said, “Scout, you can be Mrs. Radley-”\n“I declare if I will. I don’t think-”\n“‘Smatter?” said Dill. “Still scared?”\n“He can get out at night when we’re all asleep…” I said.\nJem hissed. “Scout, how’s he gonna know what we’re doin‘? Besides, I don’t \nthink he’s still there. He died years ago and they stuffed him up the chimney.”\nDill said, “Jem, you and me can play and Scout can watch if she’s scared.”\nI was fairly sure Boo Radley was inside that house, but I couldn’t prove it, and \nfelt it best to keep my mouth shut or I would be accused of believing in Hot \nSteams, phenomena I was immune to in the daytime.\nJem']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

When asked why she talks a certain way to some people, Calpurnia explains that it is necessary to adapt to the context and not always communicate using the 'white-folks' talk, as it might make others uncomfortable or aggravate them. In essence, Jem seems more attuned to cultural or socio-economic differences, while Scout appears to be more focused on respectful communication and understanding others' perspectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | Based on the provided context, Aunt Alexandra appears to define "fine folks" as socially acceptable individuals who are not considered part of the drinking streak in her family or related to people she deems unsuitable. This definition contrasts with Scout's understanding, as she seems to be curious about and interested in those same individuals, like Walter Cunningham, who are viewed unfavorably by Aunt Alexandra. Scout appears to value friendships and inclusivity, while Aunt Alexandra emphasizes social status and family lineage when defining "fine folks."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ['“Don’t be silly, Jean Louise,” said Aunt Alexandra. “The thing is, you can scrub \nWalter Cunningham till he shines, you can put him in shoes and a new suit, but \nhe’ll never be like Jem. Besides, there’s a drinking streak in that family a mile \nwide. Finch women aren’t interested in that sort of people.”\n“Aun-ty,” said Jem, “she ain’t nine yet.”\n“She may as well learn it now.”\nAunt Alexandra had spoken. I was reminded vividly of the last time she had put \nher foot down. I never knew why. It was when I was absorbed with plans to visit \nCalpurnia’s house—I was curious, interested; I wanted to be her “company,” to \nsee how she lived, who her friends were. I might as well have wanted to see the \nother side of the moon. This time the tactics were different, but Aunt Alexandra’s \naim was the same. Perhaps this was why she had come to live with us—to help us \nchoose our friends. I would hold her off as long as I could: “If they’re good folks, \nthen why can’t I be nice to Walter?”\n“I didn’t say not to be nice to him. You should be friendly and polite to him, you \nshould be gracious to everybody, dear. But you don’t have to invite him home.”\n“What if he was kin to us, Aunty?”\n“The fact is that he is not kin to us, but if he were, my answer would be the same.”\n“Aunty,” Jem spoke up, “Atticus says you can choose your friends but you sho‘ \ncan’t choose your family, an’ they’re still kin to you no matter whether you \nacknowledge ‘em or not, and it makes you look right silly when you don’t.”\n“That’s your father all over again,” said Aunt Alexandra, “and I still say that Jean \nLouise will not invite Walter Cunningham to this house. If he were her double \nfirst cousin once removed he would still not be received in this house unless he \ncomes to see Atticus on business. Now that is that.”\nShe had said Indeed Not, but this time she would give her reasons: “But'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Aunt Alexandra believes that the longer a family has been living on a single patch of land, the finer they are.

Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion, \npoisoning, and privacy, respectively. A corresponding set of mitigations for each \nclass of attacks is provided in the attack class sections. \n• Section 3 considers GenAI systems. Section 3.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor GenAI systems and defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and ad-\nversary capabilities relevant to these systems. Specific attack classes are introduced \nfor each type of capability, along with relevant mitigations. \n• Section 4 discusses remaining challenges in the field, including limitations to widely \nused mitigation techniques.

Backdoor attacks are the only attacks in the literature that require both training \nand testing data control. Model poisoning attacks could result in either targeted or back-\ndoor attacks, and the attacker modifies model parameters to cause an integrity violation. \nThey have been designed for centralized learning [222] and federated learning [22, 36]. \nPrivacy compromise [NISTAML.03] [Back to Index]. A PRIVACY COMPROMISE attack causes \nthe unintended leakage of restricted or proprietary information from a PredAI system, in-\ncluding details about a model’s training data, weights, or architecture [100, 309]. While \nthe term “confidentiality” is more widely used in taxonomies of traditional cybersecurity \nattacks, the AML field has tended to use the top-level term “privacy” to encompass both \nattacks against the confidentiality of a model (e.g., those that extract information about a \nmodel’s weights or architecture) and those that cause violations of expected privacy prop-\nerties of model outputs (e.g. by exposing model training data) [310]. DATA CONFIDENTIAL-\nITY during ML training can be achieved through secure computation methods based on \ncryptographic techniques [2, 253, 288, 385], which ensure that training data and model \nparameters remain protected during the training phase. However, even models trained \nusing paradigms that enforce data confidentiality may be vulnerable to privacy attacks, in \nwhich adversaries interacting with a model can extract information about its training data \nor parameters. In this report, we focus on privacy compromises that can occur at deploy-\nment time, regardless of the training method used, or whether data confidentiality was \nmaintained during training. \nIn privacy attacks, attackers might be interested in learning information about the training \ndata (resulting in DATA PRIVACY ATTACKS) or the ML model (resulting in MODEL PRIVACY AT-\nTACKS). The attacker could have different objectives for compromising the privacy of train-\ning data, such as DATA RECONSTRUCTION [110] (inferring the content or features of train-\ning data), MEMBERSHIP-INFERENCE ATTACK [162, 343] (inferring the presence of data in the \ntraining set), TRAINING DATA EXTRACTION [59, 63] (extracting training data from generative \nmodels), ATTRIBUTE INFERENCE ATTACKS [184, 409] (inferring sensitive attributes of training \nrecords) and PROPERTY INFERENCE [134] (inferring properties about the training data dis-\ntribution). MODEL EXTRACTION is a model privacy attack in which attackers aim to extract \ninformation about the model [177]. \n2.1.3.

Privacy Attacks and Mitigations \n[NISTAML.03] [Back to Index] \nThe seminal work of Dinur and Nissim [110] introduced DATA RECONSTRUCTION attacks, \nwhich seek to reverse-engineer private information about an individual user record or \nother sensitive input data from access to a trained model. More recently, data recon-\nstruction attacks have been designed for binary and multi-class neural network classi-\nfiers [50, 152]. With MEMBERSHIP-INFERENCE ATTACK, an adversary can determine whether \na particular record was included in the dataset used for training an ML model. Mem-\nbership inference attacks were first introduced by Homer et al. [162] for genomic data. \nRecent literature focuses on membership attacks against ML models in mostly black-box \nsettings in which adversaries have query access to a trained ML model [54, 342, 422]. Prop-\nerty inference attacks [19, 74, 134, 233, 361, 437] aim to extract global information about \na training dataset, such as the fraction of training examples with a certain sensitive at-\ntribute. A different privacy violation for MLaaS is MODEL EXTRACTION attacks, which are \ndesigned to extract information about an ML model, such as its architecture or model pa-\nrameters3 \n3A privacy violation in this context describes a loss of confidential information about an ML model. If ML \nmodel leakage leads to further privacy violations for individuals (e.g., identity theft, sensitive data extrac-\ntion), it may also be viewed as a cybersecurity-related privacy event. For further discussion on the relation-\nship between privacy and cybersecurity risks, see NIST Privacy Framework, Version 1.0. \n[58, 70, 177, 376]. \nThis section discusses privacy attacks related to data reconstruction, the memorization of \ntraining data, membership inference, property inference, and model extraction, as well as \nmitigations for some of these attacks and open problems in designing general mitigation \nstrategies. \n2.4.1. Data Reconstruction \n[\nNISTAML.032]\n [Back to Index] \nData reconstruction attacks have the ability to recover an individual’s data from released \naggregate information. Dinur and Nissim [110] were the first to introduce reconstruction \nattacks that recover user data from linear statistics. Their original attack required an ex-\nponential number of queries for reconstruction, but subsequent work has shown how to \nperform reconstruction with a polynomial number of queries [116]. A survey of privacy \nattacks, including reconstruction attacks, is given by Dwork et al. [114].

They can generate an audio waveform that is very similar to an \nexisting one but that can be transcribed to any text of the attacker’s choice. \n• Video: Adversarial evasion attacks against video classification models can be split \ninto sparse attacks that perturb a small number of video frames [401] and dense \nattacks that perturb all of the frames in a video [215]. The goal of the attacker is to \nchange the classification label of the video. \n• Text: Jia and Liang [185] developed a methodology for generating adversarial text \nexamples.

In the interval between Sunday School and Church when \nthe congregation stretched its legs, I saw Atticus standing in the yard with another \nknot of men.

The five maturity model levels are ad hoc (level 1), defined (level 2), \nconsistently implemented (level 3), managed and measurable (level 4), and optimized (level 5). \nWithin the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.  The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.\n3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.  This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.  IG should write level 4 and its gaps in maturity.

IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022. The goal of this new framework was to provide a more flexible \nbut continued focus on annual assessments for the federal community.  This effort yielded two \ndistinct groups of metrics: Core and Supplemental. \n \nCo\nre Metrics  \nThere are 20 core metrics.  The core metrics are assessed annually by the IGs and represent a \ncombination of Administration priorities, high impact security processes, and essential functions \nnecessary to determine security program effectiveness. \n \nSu\npplemental Metrics   \nSupplemental metrics are not considered a core metric but represent important activities \nconducted by security programs and contribute to the overall evaluation and determination of \nsecurity program effectiveness.  For FY 2025, the supplemental metrics comprise of five new \nmetrics designed to gauge the maturity of agencies’ cybersecurity governance practices and \nimplementation of key components of ZTA. These five metrics will be evaluated by IGs and \nscored in FY 2025.  IG wills consider the supplemental metric ratings when making the domain \nand function level maturity determinations. \n \nTerm\ns \nThe terms “organization” and “enterprise” are often used interchangeably.

Among these suggestions are several items such as System Categorization documents/worksheets, Cybersecurity Framework profiles, Risk registers/Cybersecurity risk registers (CSRRs), Risk Detail Records (RDRs), Risk heat maps, POA&Ms, Project plans/taskers, Risk Council/steering committee meeting minutes, Investment Review meeting minutes/taskers, and Lessons learned documents.

Further, IGs should explain in CyberScope the impact this has on the IGs \nability to determine the effectiveness of their agency’s information security program.  \n \n'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The OIG should consider closing the recommendation with a status of 'Unresolved - Closed' and, if appropriate, issue an updated and refocused recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                            |       1        |           0.97745  |            1        |       nan        | semantic_splitter   |

As a general best practice, broad recommendations should be \navoided.  Recommendations should be focused on specific actions to address the root cause and \nlead the agency to that next maturity level.  It may require several recommendations to get that \nmetric to the next level, however this provides the agency with specific guidance and the \nopportunity to make steady and visible progress.  This approach would also allow the assessors \nto follow-up on agency actions taken as part of their recommendation follow-up processes and/or \nthe next FISMA evaluation.  It is a matter of opinion, however generally a higher quantity of \nspecific recommendations is preferable over fewer broad recommendations.  \n \nH\now should agencies consider plans of action and milestone (POA&M)? \nAs part of the data collection process, it is recommended that assessors collect and consider open \nPOA&Ms that the organization has self-identified (or other means, such as past GAO or OIG \nreports, or assessment and authorization reviews) as issues they are working to resolve.  As a \nbest practice, assessors should avoid issuing recommendations that the organization is aware of \nand actively working to resolve.  To re-emphasize the open POA&M assessors should consider \nreferencing them in the narrative write up.  Another potential approach would be to issue an \n“Opportunity for Improvement” (OFI) or an “Item for Management’s Consideration” (IMC) to \nstate that the organization should prioritize the POA&M in order to continue to mature the \nmetric, domain, or program.  OFIs and IMCs would be an “unofficial” recommendation that the \nassessor can issue in the report that does not get tracked in monthly reports and semi-annual \nreports (SAR), but rather just goes on record to emphasize the issue.  OFIs and IMCs could \nbecome recommendations over time (generally 1-2 years) if the POA&Ms or OFIs and IMCs are \nnot timely resolved.   \n \nH\now should OIGs and agencies agree and keep recommendation remediation plans up-to-\ndate? \nOrdinarily, OIGs and Agency officials review and collaborate on recommendations to come to a \nmanagement decision.  This is either done through the agency’s official comments to the report \nor during recommendation follow-up.  During the management decision process it is critical that \nall parties are clear and agree upon the agency’s planned corrective action.  This is the time to \nensure that the planned corrective action meets the intent of the recommendation and the selected \nNIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 controls (or other applicable criteria).  A healthy back and \nforth conversation to come to an agreed upon planned corrective action will ensure that the \nimplemented corrective action also align.

| What are the six cybersecurity functions that Inspectors General use to determine an agency's effectiveness?                                                                            | The context provided does not explicitly list the six cybersecurity functions that Inspectors General (IGs) use to determine an agency's effectiveness. However, it is suggested that IGs evaluate the effectiveness of an agency in each of the following functions as part of their overall assessment: govern, identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. These functions are part of the Cybersecurity Framework mentioned in the context information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [" \n   \n4 \n \nPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL \ninformation security program is not effective because ….”  IGs should consider both their and \nthe agency’s assessment of unique missions, resources, and challenges when determining \ninformation security program effectiveness.  IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e. govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.  Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).  Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources. \n \nRe\nflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.  To facilitate this shift, and provide a foundation for assessing risk-based \nsecurity objectives, starting in FY 2025, IGs are required to assess the extent to which agencies \ndevelop and maintain cybersecurity profiles that are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize \nand communicate cybersecurity objectives. \n \nIn r\nesponse to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022. The goal of this new framework was to provide a more flexible \nbut continued focus on annual assessments for the federal community.  This effort yielded two \ndistinct groups of metrics: Core and Supplemental. \n \nCo\nre Metrics  \nThere are 20 core metrics.  The core metrics are assessed annually by the IGs and represent a \ncombination of Administration priorities, high impact security processes, and essential functions \nnecessary to determine security program effectiveness. \n \nSu\npplemental Metrics   \nSupplemental metrics are not considered a core metric but represent important activities \nconducted by security programs and contribute to the overall evaluation and determination of \nsecurity program effectiveness.  For FY 2025, the supplemental metrics comprise of five new \nmetrics designed to gauge the maturity of agencies’ cybersecurity governance practices and \nimplementation of key components of ZTA. These five metrics will be evaluated by IGs and \nscored in FY 2025.

| In the context of Generative AI, what is a 'jailbreak'?                                                                                                                                 | A "jailbreak" in the context of Generative AI refers to a successful bypass or exploitation of safety mechanisms implemented within an AI model. It can be achieved through various strategies that manipulate the input data (such as special encoding, character transformation, word transformation, and prompt-level transformation), automated model-based red teaming, or even multi-turn adaptive attacks like the Crescendo attack. The term "jailbreak" is used because it suggests the breaking out of constraints or limitations set for the AI model, similar to escaping a jail or prison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ['Approaches to mismatched generalization-based attacks include: \n1. Special encoding: Strategies that use encoding techniques like base64 to alter \nthe representation of input data in a way that remains understandable to the \nmodel but may be out of distribution for safety training. \n2. Character transformation: Strategies that use character-level transformations \nlike the ROT13 cipher, symbol replacement (e.g., l33tspeak), and Morse code \nto take the input out of the safety training distribution. \n3. Word transformation: Strategies that alter the linguistic structure of the in-\nput, such as Pig Latin, synonym swapping (e.g., using “pilfer” for “steal”), and \npayload splitting (or “token smuggling”) to break down sensitive words into \nsubstrings. \n4. Prompt-level transformation: Strategies that use prompt-level transformations, \nsuch as translating the prompt into a less common language that may be out \nof distribution of the safety training data. \n• Automated model-based red teaming employs an attacker model, a target model, \nand a judge [73, 239, 292]. When the attacker has access to a high-quality classifier \nthat judges whether model output is harmful, it may be used as a reward function to \ntrain a generative model to generate jailbreaks of another generative model. Only \nquery access is required for each of the models, and no human intervention is re-\nquired to update or refine a candidate jailbreak. The prompts may also be transfer-\nable from the target model to other closed-source LLMs [73]. \nThe Crescendo attack [316] introduced the idea of interacting with the model itera-\ntively in a multi-turn adaptive attack that includes seemingly benign prompts, even-\ntually leading to a successful jailbreak against safety alignment. The initial manual \nattack is fully automated by leveraging another LLM for prompt generation and in-\ncorporating multiple input sources. \n45 '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | A jailbreak is a direct prompting attack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as bypassing refusal behavior to enable misuse.                                                                                                                                                                                               |       1        |           0.989082 |            1        |       nan        | semantic_splitter   |

These are demonstrations of evasion vulnerabilities by researchers, \nbut did not result in attacks in the wild. \n2.2.5. Mitigations \nMitig\nating evasion attacks is challenging because adversarial examples are widespread in \na variety of ML model architectures and application domains. Possible explanations for \nthe existence of adversarial examples are that ML models rely on non-robust features that \nare not aligned with human perception in the computer vision domain [174]. In the last \nfew years, many of the proposed mitigations against adversarial examples have been in-\neffective against stronger attacks. Furthermore, several papers have performed extensive \nevaluations and defeated a large number of proposed mitigations: \n• Carlini and Wagner showed how to bypass 10 methods for detecting adversarial ex-\namples and described several guidelines for evaluating defenses [64]. Recent work \nshows that detecting adversarial examples is as difficult as building a defense [373]. \nTherefore, this direction for mitigating adversarial examples is similarly challenging \nas designing defenses. \n• The Obfuscated Gradients attack [20] was specifically designed to defeat several pro-\nposed defenses that rely on masking gradients to protect against optimization-based \nattacks. It relies on a new technique, Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation, \nwhich approximates the gradient during the backward pass of backpropagation, and \nwas shown to bypass several proposed defenses based on gradient masking. \n• Tramèr et al. [375] described a methodology for designing adaptive attacks against \nproposed defenses and circumvented 13 existing defenses. They advocate for de-\nsigning adaptive attacks to test newly proposed defenses rather than merely testing \nthe defenses against well-known attacks. \nFrom the wide range of proposed defenses against adversarial evasion attacks, three main \nclasses have proven to be resilient and have the potential to provide mitigation against \nevasion attacks: \n1.

A common approach to mitigating prompt stealing \nis to compare the model utterance to the prompt, which is known by the sys-\ntem provider . Defenses differ in how this comparison is made, which might \ninclude looking for a specific token, word, or phrase, as popularized by [59], or \ncomparing the n-grams of the output to the input [439]. Similarly, defenses for \nprompt stealing have yet to be proven rigorous. \n– Input modification. User input can additionally be modified prior to being \npassed to the model, such as paraphrasing or retokenizing [182]. However, \nsuch methods may be expensive and/or have trade-offs with model perfor-\nmance. \n– Aggregating output from multiple prompts. Motivated by randomized smooth-\ning [95] used to improve robustness against evasion attacks for ML classifiers, \nSmoothLLM [312] proposes aggregating the LLM output from multiple ran-\ndomly perturbed prompts. This defense incurs a cost of generating multiple \nLLM queries for each prompt and might reduce the quality of the generated \noutput. \n']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |

I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I \nplayed that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jem’s assurances that \nBoo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in \nthe daytime and Atticus home at night.\nJem was a born hero.\nIt was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and \nneighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr. \nRadley and lost all her money. She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her \nright forefinger (Dill’s contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldn’t find \nany cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the \ntime, while Boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house.\nThe three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for a \nchange; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with \nthe brushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff, \nassorted townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the \nRadleys than anybody in Maycomb.\nWhen it was time to play Boo’s big scene, Jem would sneak into the house, steal \nthe scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when Calpurnia’s back was turned, \nthen sit in the swing and cut up newspapers. Dill would walk by, cough at Jem, \nand Jem would fake a plunge into Dill’s thigh.

You got anything needs readin‘ I \ncan do it…”\n“How old are you,” asked Jem, “four-and-a-half?”\n“Goin‘ on seven.”\n“Shoot no wonder, then,” said Jem, jerking his thumb at me. “Scout yonder’s \nbeen readin‘ ever since she was born, and she ain’t even started to school yet. You \nlook right puny for goin’ on seven.”\n“I’m little but I’m old,” he said.\nJem brushed his hair back to get a better look. “Why don’t you come over, \nCharles Baker Harris?” he said. “Lord, what a name.”\n“‘s not any funnier’n yours. Aunt Rachel says your name’s Jeremy Atticus Finch.”\nJem scowled. “I’m big enough to fit mine,” he said.

However, it is known that Atticus Finch, one of the characters in the story, was present in important moments throughout the narrative and demonstrated bravery and kindness towards his children. It is unclear if he saves them at the end of the book as the provided context does not go that far into the story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ['“Heard every word you said,” I muttered. “…\nwasn’t sleep at all, ‘s about a ship an’ Three-Fingered Fred ‘n’ Stoner’s Boy…”\nHe unhooked my overalls, leaned me against him, and pulled them off.

She made me feel \nawful, but when Jem came to fetch me he was sympathetic. He said he couldn’t \nsee my costume much from where he was sitting. How he could tell I was feeling \nbad under my costume I don’t know, but he said I did all right, I just came in a \nlittle late, that was all. Jem was becoming almost as good as Atticus at making \nyou feel right when things went wrong.

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | In the provided document, a white-box evasion attack refers to an attack where the adversary has full knowledge of the system being targeted. This includes access to the model architecture, training data, and parameters. On the other hand, a black-box evasion attack occurs when the adversary lacks such detailed information about the target system.

| Summarize the plot of the 'Boo Radley' game that Jem, Scout, and Dill play.                                                                                                             | The provided text suggests that Jem, Scout, and Dill play a game they call "Boo Radley." In this game, Jem takes on the role of a villain, Dill acts out various character parts, and Scout is assigned the role of Mrs. Radley. They plan to act this game out, but Scout expresses fear about playing it at night when everyone is asleep, suspecting that Boo Radley might still be present in his house. However, Jem believes that Boo has died years ago and is not a part of their game anymore. The roles are distributed with Jem and Dill acting and Scout watching if she's scared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ['and sweep the porch. Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up and down the \nsidewalk and coughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally, was Boo: he went \nunder the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time.\nAs the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected it, added \ndialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang \nchanges every day.\nDill was a villain’s villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and \nappear tall if height was part of the devilry required.

Jem seems to imply that there are differences that one might not understand, suggesting a complexity or nuance beyond just being good or bad. On the other hand, their aunt seems to judge based on cultural or social preferences, stating that these people may be good but they're "not our kind of folks". This suggests that Jem and Scout view 'folks' differently in terms of personal character (Jem) versus cultural or societal norms (Aunt).

| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | In the provided context, Aunt Alexandra does not explicitly define what she means by "our kind of folks," but it seems to imply a certain societal or cultural status. On the other hand, Scout, being young and naive, perceives these people as good because they are kind-hearted individuals (as indicated in her question, "Why not, Aunty? They’re good folks."). However, Aunt Alexandra's statement suggests that even if these individuals are good, they do not belong to their particular social circle or class.

Section 2.1 introduces the taxonomy of attacks \nfor PredAI systems, which defines the broad categories of attacker objectives and \ngoals, and identifies the capabilities that an adversary must leverage to achieve the \ncorresponding objectives. Specific attack classes are also introduced for each type \nof capability. Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the major classes of attacks: evasion,'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | The three main attacker objectives are availability breakdown, integrity violation, and privacy compromise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       0.666667 |           0.954297 |            1        |       nan        | recursive_character |

However, this sentiment seems to be expressed by someone who has a deep understanding of courage and its true nature, which suggests that it could potentially be a character of wisdom or insight within the story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ['maybe… son, I told you that if you hadn’t lost your head I’d have made you go \nread to her.

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but \nremember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\nThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I \nasked Miss Maudie about it.\n“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music \nfor us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they \ndon’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a \nmockingbird.”'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | A Mockingbird.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     nan        |           0.967629 |            1        |       nan        | recursive_character |

However, based on the mention of "yellow drugstore straws" running into the paper sack, one might infer that the content of the sack could potentially be some sort of drink, possibly alcohol. This is just an inference, as it's not confirmed by the provided context information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ['their food with drugstore Coca-Cola in bulb-shaped soda glasses.

This is suggested by the statements "It was clear-cut self defense" and "She said Jem got up and yanked him off her."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ['eyes. “Jem’s not quite thirteen… no, he’s already thirteen—I can’t remember. \nAnyway, it’ll come before county court—”\n“What will, Mr. Finch?” Mr. Tate uncrossed his legs and leaned forward.\n“Of course it was clear-cut self defense, but I’ll have to go to the office and hunt \nup—”\n“Mr. Finch, do you think Jem killed Bob Ewell?

| Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document.                                                                                 | A white-box attack in the context provided assumes that an adversary has comprehensive knowledge about the Machine Learning (ML) system they are targeting, including details like architecture, training data, hyperparameters, and more. On the other hand, a black-box attack operates under minimal or no information about the ML system. In this scenario, an attacker might only have query access to the model but lacks knowledge regarding its training procedure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ['vacy, SP 2020, San Francisco, CA, USA, May 18-21, 2020, pages 1277–1294.

Jem assumes the role of Boo, hiding under the front steps and making sounds, while Dill acts as an old man named Mr. Radley who interacts with Jem on the sidewalk. The children take turns adjusting their roles, adding dialogue and plot to the game as it evolves over time, ultimately creating a small play revolving around Boo Radley.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ['Dill said, “Jem, you and me can play and Scout can watch if she’s scared.”\nI was fairly sure Boo Radley was inside that house, but I couldn’t prove it, and \nfelt it best to keep my mouth shut or I would be accused of believing in Hot \nSteams, phenomena I was immune to in the daytime.\nJem parceled out our roles: I was Mrs. Radley, and all I had to do was come out'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The game is a 'melancholy little drama' based on neighborhood gossip.

We polished and perfected it, added \ndialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang \nchanges every day.\nDill was a villain’s villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |                    |                     |                  |                     |
| Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23.                                                      | In the provided excerpts, both Jem and Scout question why different groups of people cannot get along with each other despite being similar or alike. However, it is not explicitly stated how they perceive the differences between 'folks'. It seems that Jem, as suggested by his declining mood, has developed a more mature understanding of these differences and the reasons for conflict, while Scout does not yet understand the complexity of this issue. This difference in their views on the topic is subtly hinted at, but it is not explicitly stated or directly discussed between them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ['folks. Folks.”\nJem turned around and punched his pillow. When he settled back his face was \ncloudy. He was going into one of his declines, and I grew wary. His brows came \ntogether; his mouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while.\n“That’s what I thought, too,” he said at last, “when I was your age.

| How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?                                                                                        | In the provided text, Aunt Alexandra doesn't explicitly define what she means by "fine folks." However, her statement suggests that they are good people, but not from a social circle or background that she considers appropriate. Contrasting with Scout's understanding, it seems she is more focused on the social status or origins of people rather than their moral qualities. This is evident when she says, "But they’re not our kind of folks." Scout, on the other hand, values people based on their character and actions, as shown in her desire to visit Calpurnia's house out of curiosity and interest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ['with us sometime, okay, Jem?”\n“We’ll see about that,” Aunt Alexandra said, a declaration that with her was \nalways a threat, never a promise.

| According to the FY 2025 IG FISMA Metrics Evaluation Guide, what does OMB consider an 'effective' level of security?                                                                    | The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), as per the context provided in the FY 2025 IG FISMA Metrics Evaluation Guide, considers achieving managed and measurable (level 4) or above to represent an effective level of security. However, it's important to note that an Information Governance (IG) has discretion to determine if an agency's information security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve level 4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ['Within the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.

Therefore, the likely narrator could be one of the children, Scout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ['“Do you really think that, son?

| Describe the 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level for the metric regarding an organization's inventory of information systems.                                                     | The 'Consistently Implemented' maturity level refers to a state where the organization routinely implements its policies, procedures, and processes to maintain a comprehensive and accurate inventory of its information systems (including cloud systems, public-facing websites, and third-party systems), as well as system interconnections.

This is unlike a black-box attack, where the attacker has minimal or no knowledge of the ML system, and may even encounter deliberately obscured or misleading information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ['As in PredAI, attackers can also vary in their knowledge of the underlying ML model, from \nfull knowledge of the ML system including model weights (white-box attacks), to minimal \nknowledge and systems with deliberately obscured or misleading information (black-box \nattacks), to somewhere in between (gray-box attacks).

| Summarize the plot of the 'Boo Radley' game that Jem, Scout, and Dill play.                                                                                                             | In the given context, it appears that Jem, Scout, and Dill engage in a game involving Boo Radley, a mysterious neighbor they rarely see. The objective of their game seems to be observing and speculating about Mr. Radley by peeping at his window with a loose shutter. Additionally, they personify Mr. Radley as Dill and Boo as Jem, where Jem hides under the front steps to represent Boo Radley, making shrieking and howling noises from time to time. As the summer progresses, this game or their interactions with the Radley house continue to develop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ['“Well?” said Dill.\n“Okay,” said Jem. “Why don’t you go on home, Scout?”\n“What are you gonna do?”\nDill and Jem were simply going to peep in the window with the loose shutter to \nsee if they could get a look at Boo Radley, and if I didn’t want to go with them I \ncould go straight home and keep my fat flopping mouth shut, that was all.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | The game is a 'melancholy little drama' based on neighborhood gossip.

| Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23.                                                      | In the provided context, it appears that while both Jem and Scout recognize differences among people, their interpretations of those differences seem to vary. Jem seems to view these distinctions as cultural or behavioral, such as preferences for hobbies or manners, which he refers to as 'yappy' or 'tacky.' On the other hand, Scout appears to be less discriminating and more accepting, as she expresses an interest in the same activities Jem considers unrefined. The adult character, however, expresses concern about Scout's potential aggression when her pride is at stake, suggesting a deeper understanding of social hierarchies and potentially more complex differences between people that go beyond cultural preferences or manners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ['“Jean Louise, there is no doubt in my \nmind that they’re good folks.
