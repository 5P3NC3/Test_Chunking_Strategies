The idea is to solve my problem and learn Swift UI development along the way, while giving back to the community with this open-source project!

That time, I thought to use Google Form, but it was way too blocky and looked very unprofessional on my agency website.\\u003cp\\u003eSo I thought to build my own forms for my own usage, and it turns out it almost doubled form submissions and inquiry calls.\\u003cp\\u003eI was happy, so I thought to build it for everyone and make it open-source.\\u003cp\\u003eI added AI functionalities using Vercel AISDK. I can generate forms almost instantly using AI and also added analytics AI so that users can talk with their forms—more like talk with their analytics data.\\u003cp\\u003eI\'ve been building this publicly, sharing updates on my X account (preetsuthar17)\\u003cp\\u003eI hope this product will be as helpful to you as it was for me.

| What is the description of the "DESIGN and DEVELOPMENT" category?                                                                                                     | The context provided does not explicitly describe a "Design and Development" category. However, it does provide details about several competency areas and work roles that could potentially fall under a broader "Design and Development" category. For instance, the "Competency Area" titled "Cyber Resiliency" describes designing systems with cyber resources, while "DevSecOps" is about integrating security as part of development. The work role "Technology Research and Development" also seems to involve designing new capabilities. However, it would be up to the specific context or system to define a "Design and Development" category using these competency areas and work roles as potential components.                                                                                                                                                        | ['"element_type": "competency_area",\n            "element_identifier": "NF-COM-007",\n            "title": "Cyber Resiliency",\n            "text": "This Competency Area describes a learner\\u2019s capability related to architecting, designing, developing, implementing, and maintaining the trustworthiness of systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources in order to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises.",\n            "doc_identifier": "SP_800_181_rev_1"\n        },\n        {\n            "element_type": "competency_area",\n            "element_identifier": "NF-COM-008",\n            "title": "DevSecOps",\n            "text": "This Competency Area describes a learner\\u2019s capabilities to integrate security as a shared responsibility throughout the development, security, and operations (DevSecOps) life cycle of technologies.",\n            "doc_identifier": "SP_800_181_rev_1"\n        },\n        {\n            "element_type": "competency_area",\n            "element_identifier": "NF-COM-009",\n            "title": "Operating Systems (OS) Security",\n            "text": "This Competency Area describes a learner\\u2019s capabilities to install, administer, troubleshoot, backup, and conduct recovery of Operating Systems (OS), including in simulated environments.",\n            "doc_identifier": "SP_800_181_rev_1"\n        },'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Conducts research, conceptualizes, designs, develops, and tests secure technology systems, including on perimeter and cloud-based networks.                                                            |       0.2      |           0.822869 |                 1   |         0        | token_text_splitter |

| Which competency area describes a learner’s capability to protect cloud data, applications, and infrastructure?                                                       | The context provided does not explicitly state that either competency area describes a learner's capability to protect cloud data, applications, and infrastructure. However, both competency areas seem to deal with cybersecurity and digital resources, which could indirectly involve protecting cloud-based systems. The first competency area titled "Cyber Resiliency" discusses the ability to design, implement, and maintain trustworthy systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources. The second one, "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Security," talks about securing AI against cyberattacks and ensuring it is contained where used.

However, if we were to infer from the terms given ("Operational Technology (OT) Cybersecurity Engineering", "Operational Technology (OT) Security"), it can be presumed that "COMSEC" in this context may stand for "Communications Security".
