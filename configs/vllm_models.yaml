  - question: "How many core metrics are assessed annually by the IGs in the FISMA evaluation?"
    answer: "There are 20 core metrics that are assessed annually by the Inspectors General (IGs)."
  - question: "What should an OIG do if a recommendation from a FISMA evaluation is overcome by events (OBE)?"
    answer: "The OIG should consider closing the recommendation with a status of 'Unresolved - Closed' and, if appropriate, issue an updated and refocused recommendation."
  - question: "What are the six cybersecurity functions that Inspectors General use to determine an agency's effectiveness?"
    answer: "The six Cybersecurity Framework Functions are: govern, identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover."
  - question: "What are the two broad classes of AI systems distinguished in the NIST AI 100-2e2025 report?"

  - question: "In the context of Generative AI, what is a 'jailbreak'?"
    answer: "A jailbreak is a direct prompting attack intended to circumvent restrictions placed on model outputs, such as bypassing refusal behavior to enable misuse."
  - question: "What are the three primary classes of defenses against adversarial evasion attacks, according to the NIST AI report?"

  - question: "Explain the difference between a white-box and a black-box attack as per the NIST AI security document."
    answer: "A white-box attack assumes the attacker has full knowledge of the machine learning system, including training data and architecture. A black-box attack assumes the attacker has minimal or no knowledge, often only having query access to the model's predictions."
  - question: "Summarize the plot of the 'Boo Radley' game that Jem, Scout, and Dill play."
    answer: "The game is a 'melancholy little drama' based on neighborhood gossip. The plot includes scenes where Boo (played by Jem) is locked up by his father, stabs his father's leg with scissors, and is eventually stuffed up a chimney. The children play various roles, including the Radley family members, the probate judge, and Miss Stephanie Crawford."
  - question: "What is the 'hybrid search strategy' proposed by BreakPoint Labs in the ERDC proposal?"
    answer: "The hybrid search strategy combines the strengths of keyword-based retrieval methods like BM25 with vector search. It will also integrate reranker models into the pipeline to refine search results and ensure accuracy."
  - question: "Explain the difference between Jem and Scout's views on what makes 'folks' different from one another, as discussed in Chapter 23."
    answer: "Jem believes there are four kinds of folks, separated by class and race (e.g., ordinary like the Finches, Cunninghams, Ewells, and Negroes), and that background is determined by how long a family has been literate. Scout argues that there is 'just one kind of folks. Folks.'"
  - question: "How does Aunt Alexandra define 'Fine Folks' and how does it contrast with Scout's understanding?"
    answer: "Aunt Alexandra believes that the longer a family has been living on a single patch of land, the finer they are. Scout had previously thought that 'Fine Folks' were people who did the best they could with the sense they had."
